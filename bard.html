        <h5 id="bard_decipher_script">DECIPHER SCRIPT (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
Bards often need to decipher and interpret legends and secret writings to acquire
more knowledge. This ability allows the bard to decipher
writing in an unfamiliar language, a message written in an
incomplete or archaic form or a message written in code. If the
check succeeds, the character understands the general content
of a piece of writing. It takes ten minutes to decipher each page
of a script. A decipher script check may be made only once per
writing. A bard may use this ability to decipher and then use
an arcane scroll, as a wizard or illusionist would, if a successful
check is made at a penalty of –10. This ability may not be used
to decipher divine scrolls.

<h5 id="bard_exalt">EXALT (CHARISMA)</h5>

This is the bard’s ability to inspire
companions and listeners, allowing them to surpass their
normal level of performance. Some bards invoke this ability
through song and music, while others do so through oration,
battle cries or sheer acting and demeanor. With a successful
attribute check, a bard can help allies succeed at a task. The
ally gets a +2 bonus on any action requiring an attribute check,
including class ability checks, saving throws and standard
attribute checks. This ability does not affect attack rolls. The
allies must be able to see and hear the bard, and must be within
60 feet. The Castle Keeper may rule that certain uses of this
ability are infeasible. The bard can use this ability once per day
per level, and can maintain the effect for a number of rounds
equal to the bard’s level. The bard can take other actions while
using this ability, unless the Castle Keeper rules otherwise. As
the bard rises in levels, the bonus imparted increases as well. It
rises to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 12th level and +5 at 18th level.

<h5 id="bard_legend_lore">LEGEND LORE (CHARISMA)</h5>

Bards are lore masters of
myth and archaic knowledge. With a successful attribute check,
a bard gains or remembers some relevant information about
local notables, a legendary item, a noteworthy place or any
other relevant bit of information. Gaining the information may
entail speaking to local inhabitants and/ or doing research. The
information might prove useful in diplomacy, entertaining, or
otherwise influencing others. The ability also might impart a full
or partial understanding of local or secret languages, including
rogue’s cant, the secret druidic language or ranger signs.
The check will not reveal the powers of a magic item, but may
give a hint to its history, general function or activation. The
Castle Keeper gauges the challenge level of the check based on
whether the knowledge is:

<p><b>Common:</b> This constitutes information known by at least a
substantial minority of the local population.</p>
<p><b>Uncommon:</b> The information is known by only a few people in
the area, though easy to track down.</p>
<p><b>Obscure:</b> The information is known by a few, but rather hard
to come by.</p>
<p><b>Extremely Obscure:</b> The information is known by very few
scholars and sages, possibly forgotten by most who once knew
it, or possibly known only by those who don’t understand the
significance of the knowledge.</p>

<h5 id="bard_fascinate">FASCINATE</h5>
At 4th level, a bard gains the ability to place
a single creature into a trance. The creature to be fascinated
must be able to see and hear the bard, and the bard must also
see the creature. The creature must be able to pay attention to
the bard. The distraction of a nearby combat or other danger
will prevent the ability from working. The Bard can use music,
poetry, chanting, speech, whistling, playing an instrument or
any combination of the above to produce the intended effect
on the creature, as long as some verbal performance is included.
Bards can use this ability three times per day, and can maintain
the effect for a number of rounds equal to their level.
When a bard uses this ability, the target makes a charisma
saving throw to resist the bard’s spellsong. If the saving throw
fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the bard for up to
the full duration of the effect. While using this ability, a bard
must concentrate, as if casting or maintaining a spell. While
fascinated, the target is treated as if prone and also suffers a
-4 penalty to all saving throws and a -5 to armor class. If the
creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to
fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. Any threat that is
obvious to the fascinated creature, such as the casting of a spell,
drawing of a sword or aiming of a weapon automatically breaks
the effect.
<p>As the bard rises in levels, the power of the fascination increases
as well, allowing the bard to further influence the listener through
suggestion. These specialized uses of the fascinate ability can only
be performed on creatures who are under the influence of the
bard’s fascinate ability. At 5th level, a bard may attempt a charm
person on a fascinated creature. At 8th level, a bard may attempt
to implant a suggestion into a fascinated creature. At 12th level,
a bard may attempt antipathy/ sympathy on a fascinated creature.
At 18th level, a bard may attempt a mass suggestion on fascinated
creatures. In each case, the creature receives a saving throw to
attempt to resist the spellsong.</p>

<p>As the bard gains experience, the number of creatures that can
be affected by the fascination, or one of its specialized uses,
increases. The number of creatures is equal to two fewer than
the level of the bard. For example, a 4th level bard can fascinate
2 creatures, a 6th level bard can fascinate 4 creatures, and a 12th
level bard can fascinate 10 creatures.</p>

<h5 id="bard_exhort_greatness">EXHORT GREATNESS</h5>
At 9th level, a bard can inspire
greatness in one other creature. For every two levels the
bard attains beyond 9th, the bard can inspire greatness in an
additional creature. To inspire greatness, the bard must use
song, poetry or some sort of oration. The creature to be inspired
must be able to hear the bard, and must be within 30 feet for
the effect to take place. A creature inspired with greatness gains
temporary hit points and attack bonuses for as long as the bard
is within its hearing and the bard continues to sing or orate.
This effect lasts for one minute, or six rounds, at 9th level, and
the duration increases by one additional round for every level
beyond 9th. The creature can move out of the 30 foot radius
once the exhortation has begun, but it must still be able to hear
the bard at all times.
<p>The target creature gains a +2 bonus on all ‘to hit’ rolls, and
gains temporary hit points as if two hit dice (or levels) higher.
Apply the creature’s constitution modifier, if any, to each bonus
hit point roll. See the combat section for a detailed explanation
of temporary hit points.</p>
