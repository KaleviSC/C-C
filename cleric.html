  <h5 id="cleric_spells">SPELLS</h5>
  A cleric casts divine spells. The spells available are
listed on the cleric spell list. A cleric is limited to a certain
number of spells of each spell level per day. The Cleric and
Druid Spells Per Day Table (pg 28) shows the number of spells
per day a character of the class may cast. Clerics prepare spells
each day through prayer to their deity or deities, followed by
contemplation and study.

<h6 style="color:red;">BONUS SPELLS</h6>
High wisdom indicates a greater divine connection.Clerics with a high wisdom gain bonus spells.  If they have a wisdom modifier of +1 or higher they recieve an extra 1st level spell.
  If the wisdom modifier is +2 or higher, they recieve an extra second level spell and so on.
  Bonus spells can only be aquired if the cleric is at a high enough level to cast them. Bonus spells are cumulative.

  <h5 id="cleric_turn_undead">TURN UNDEAD</h5>
  A cleric has the ability to turn,
    or even destroy, undead monsters. To turn undead, a cleric must
  declare the attempt as an attack and then make a successful
  wisdom attribute check. The character must display a holy
  symbol toward the undead and utter a prayer, chant or other
  invocation of the character’s deity. Turn undead is considered
  a special attack and takes one round. Turn undead has a
  maximum range of 60 feet.
  Turning undead consists of channelling divine power. The
  ability to channel divine power is measured by the cleric’s
  own willpower. Accordingly, charisma, not wisdom, affects the
  number of undead creatures that are turned with a successful
  turn undead check. In most cases, the number of undead turned
  will be 1d12 plus the cleric’s charisma modifier. When a cleric
  is five or more levels higher than the undead being turned, the
  undead are instead destroyed.
  Evil clerics may, instead of turning undead, control them. An evil
  cleric must be at least five levels higher than the hit dice of the
  undead sought to be controlled. Evil clerics can also turn paladins.

  <p><button onclick="myFunction()" >PHB p.180 on Turning Undead</button></p>

  <div id="myDIV">

    <h5>TURN UNDEAD (WISDOM)</h5>

    Turn undead requires a successful
wisdom attribute check. The challenge level for the check is
equal to the undead creature’s hit dice. A successful turn
undead check results in the undead monster being turned or
destroyed. Alternately, evil characters with this ability can
attempt to control the undead or even paladins. In game terms,
turning undead should be considered a special, ranged combat
attack. The maximum range for turning undead is 60 feet.
<p>If the turn undead attempt fails, however, the cleric may not
attempt to turn that specific group of undead again for the
remainder of the combat and one full day has passed. Again,
using the situation described above, if the cleric failed to turn
the zombies, he could attempt to turn the skeletons or vampire
in round two, but could not attempt to turn the zombies again
for that combat. The only exception is that newly arrived
creatures of the same type, or in a different group, can be
turned. So, in the example situation, if a new group of zombies
joins the combat, the cleric could attempt to turn the new group
of zombies. Essentially, a cleric has one chance to turn each
opponent in a combat or 24 hour period, with each opponent
being composed of a group of undead of the same type.</p>

    <h6>NUMBER OF UNDEAD TURNED</h6>
<p>The number of undead monsters that are turned is determined
by special rules and depends on the undead monster’s type:
common, extraordinary or unique.</p>

<p>Common undead are non-sentient, automaton-like undead such
as skeletons and zombies. Extraordinary undead are semi-sentient
undead of great power that usually have special abilities. They
typically are trapped between the material and spirit worlds, and
include such monsters as wraiths and ghosts. Unique undead are
those rare and powerful creatures of strong will and intelligence
such as vampires and liches. The turn undead ability affects 1d12
common undead, 1d6 extraordinary undead, or 1 unique undead.
For each type, the number turned is increased or decreased by the
cleric or paladin’s charisma modifier.</p>

<p><b>Turned Undead:</b> Turned undead flee at their full movement rate for ten rounds.
If unable to flee, they will cower. A +2 bonus to hit is awarded
on all attacks versus cowering undead. If the cleric approaches
within ten feet, or attacks a cowering undead monster, the
turning is broken and the undead creature will attack. Others
may attack the cowering creature without breaking the turning
effect. Turned undead will not automatically flee evil clerics.
Instead, they are rebuked and will cower in awe.</p>

<p><b>Destroying Undead:</b> If the cleric or paladin is five levels higher than the hit dice of the
type of undead being turned, the character destroys the undead
instead of turning them. The number destroyed is the same as
the number of undead that the character would normally turn.
If a cleric or paladin is ten levels higher than the hit dice of
the undead being turned, the character automatically destroys
the maximum possible number of undead. For example, a 12th
level cleric making a successful turn undead check against 1
hit dice skeletons automatically destroys 12 skeletons plus the
character’s charisma modifier.</p>

    <h6>EVIL CLERICS</h6>
    Evil clerics can assume control of undead instead of turning
    them, and can also turn paladins as if the paladins were
    undead. The evil cleric makes a normal turn undead check
    to do so. If the check is a success, and the cleric is five levels
    higher than the hit dice of the type of undead being turned,
    the cleric may control the undead instead of destroying them.
    The number controlled is equal to the number of undead that
    the cleric would normally turn. If an evil cleric is ten levels
higher than the hit dice of the type of undead sought to be
controlled, the character automatically controls the maximum
possible number of undead.

Controlled undead become permanent servants under the
evil cleric’s mental command unless released. The cleric
must take an action to give mental orders to controlled
undead. Control can be freely passed from one evil cleric
to another if the recipient cleric passes a turn check of
his own. At no time, however, may an evil cleric control
a number of undead whose total hit dice is greater than 5
times the cleric’s level. Thus, a 5th level evil cleric could
control a maximum of 25 skeletons.
