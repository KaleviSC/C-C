<h5 id="archer_master_archer">MASTER ARCHER</h5>
Archers gain +1 to hit and damage
with any bow or crossbow. At 7th level, this bonus increases
to +2 to hit and damage.

<h5 id="archer_eagle_eye">EAGLE EYE</h5>

Through his ability to shoot with the wind,
lead targets, and sight in on a small target zone, the archer
can double the effective range of any bow or crossbow
that he uses. However, due to the intense concentration required
to make such shots, the archer cannot perform dual
shots, blinding speed, or unstable firing when employing
eagle eye.

<h5 id="archer_unstable_shooting">UNSTABLE SHOOTING</h5>

The archer suffers no penalty
when firing his bow from a moving vehicle, from horseback,
or from other unstable positions. However, the concentration
required forbids the use of blinding speed, dual shots, or
eagle eye when employing unstable shooting.

<h5 id="archer_master_bowyer">MASTER BOWYER (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
Given the proper tools and
materials, such as conditioned staves of wood, the archer can
manufacture and repair traditional bows, strings, and arrows.
These bows are of the classic variety: long bows, flat bows, recurves,
composite bows, horse bows, etc.

<p>If the proper materials are not available, the archer is
limited in what he can doâ€”with a successful Intelligence
check, repairs can be affected, and a new, temporary-use
bow can be created, but these weapons will be at -1 to
hit and damage, and range will be reduced by 10%. In
addition, on an imploding dice result, the bow may snap;
if the imploding follow-up roll on a natural one comes
up six, the bow snaps and is irreparable. In addition,
the archer takes 1d6 damage from the breaking bow as
the tension flies back at him. If the imploding die result
is less than 6, the wood creaks and cracks, and the bow
weakens further, suffering a cumulative additional -1 to
hit and damage, and a further 10% reduction in range.
Most archers keep a supply of staves and tools at their
home base, wherever that may be.</p>

<h5 id="archer_blinding_speed">BLINDING SPEED</h5>
At 2nd level, if the archer has a bow in hand, arrow nocked and ready with his
other hand on the string, prepared to draw, he gains +4 on initiative in combat.

<h5 id="archer_rapid_shot">RAPID SHOT</h5>
At 3rd level, the archer increases his rate of
fire with a bow to 2 shots per round. At seventh level, he is
capable of firing 3 shots per round, and at fifteenth level, he
can fire 4 shots per round.


<h5 id="archer_deadeye_shot">DEADEYE SHOT (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
At 5th level, an archer is able to incapacitate an opponent upon a successful
called shot (-8 to hit).
Called shots may only be made if the archer takes the time to aim and fire.
The attacker must remain stationary in their firing stance for one full round
 before making their called shot. The archer must score a hit roll upon the
 target and make a successful intelligence check to incapacitate to succeed.

<p>If successful, the arrow strikes the victim in such a way as to temporarily
incapacitate the target. For instance, the arrow may have severed a nerve in the
 leg or arm, forcing the target to fall to the ground or drop their weapon. The
 target is physically incapacitated for 2 rounds. They cannot act offensively
 though they can still speak, crawl about etc. Any attacks made against them are
 made at +5.</p>


 <h5 id="archer_combat_sense">COMBAT SENSE</h5>
At 7th level, the archer is able to sense an arrow coming at them. Sense arrow
allows them to intuit the tell-tale signs of the arrow or bolt being fired. The
terrain around him may be ideal for a shot, the slight sound of the bow bending,
the twang of the string, the arrow flying. This sense increases their AC
against an arrow or bolt being shot at them by +1 for every 3 levels. ie +1
at 7th level, +2 at 10th level etc. to a maximum of +5. The archer cannot use
dual shots during the round.
