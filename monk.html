<h5 id="monk_fast_movement">FAST MOVEMENT</h5>
A monk moves faster than normal. A
monk carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed
and moves at 30’. See the Monk Special Abilities Chart for a
monk’s movement rate.

<h5 id="monk_hand_to_hand_combat">HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT</h5>

A monk specializes in hand-tohand
combat, be it boxing, brawling, wrestling, or a complex,
disciplined martial art. This martial skill imparts the unique
ability to attack with hand, foot, other body part, or the whole
body, and aids in defense.
<p>The monk’s hand-to-hand attacks and damage are shown in the
Monk Special Abilities table. A monk begins with a single handto-
hand attack, and at 6th level gains an additional off-hand,
secondary attack. The amount of damage theses attacks inflict
is shown in the table. A monk character may choose whether
damage inflicted by a successful hand-to-hand attack inflicts
normal damage or subdual damage as described in the Damage
entry of The Castle Keeper & The Game section of this book.</p>
<p>A monk’s martial skill and body control allows him to use his
body for defense. A monk’s base armor class increases with
experience as indicated on the table.</p>
<p>The monk adds +2 to all overbearing and grappling attacks.</p>

<h5 id="monk_iron_body">IRON BODY</h5>

A monk’s training and bodily control creates a
hardiness and toughness that makes the monk more resistant
than normal to harmful toxins and diseases as well as effects that
control, paralyze, or kill. At 1st level, the character gains a +1
bonus to saving throws versus disease, poison, paralysis, polymorph,
petrification and death attack. The bonus increases to +2 at 3rd
level, +3 at 6th level, +4 at 10th level, and +5 at 15th level.

<h5 id="monk_stun_attack">STUN ATTACK</h5>
Monks can focus a hand-to-hand attack
so as to stun an opponent. The monk must declare use of the
stun attack before making the attack roll. A foe successfully
struck by the attack must make a constitution saving throw or
be stunned and unable to act for 1d4 rounds. Those struck by
a stun attack take normal unarmed attack damage. The monk
can use this ability once per round, but but no more than once
per level per day. A missed attack counts against the monk’s
daily limitation of use of the ability. The first stun attack must
be a primary attack (be it by hand or weapon).

<h5 id="monk_deflect_missiles">DEFLECT MISSILES</h5>
At 2nd level, a monk’s reflexes and
body control allows him the ability to deflect non-magical
missiles, including but not limited to, arrows, axes, bolas, bolts,
bullets, clubs, daggers, darts, hammers, harpoons, javelins, nets,
rocks, and spears. The monk must have at least one hand free
to use this ability. When the monk would normally be hit by
a ranged weapon, the monk can attempt to deflect the attack
by making a dexterity check. If the check succeeds, the monk
deflects the weapon and suffers no damage. This can be done
once per round for levels 2-5, twice per round for levels 6-10,
three times per round for levels 11 to 15, four times per round
for levels 16-19, and five times per round for levels 20 and up.

<p>The monk must be aware of the attack to use this ability.
An attempt to deflect a ranged weapon counts as a monk’s
primary unarmed attack. If a monk is high enough level to
have a secondary unarmed attack, the monk may still make
the secondary attack if the deflect missile ability has only been
used once or twice. If three or more missiles are deflected, the
secondary attack is considered used. This ability cannot be used
against siege weapon ammunition.</p>

<h5 id="monk_iron_fists">IRON FISTS</h5>

Beginning at 3rd level, a monk has begun to
master his martial ability to such an extent that his unarmed
attacks strike as if dealt by a magic weapon. Thus, the monk can
strike and damage creatures hit only by magic weapons. At 3rd
level, the monk’s unarmed attack is equal a +1 magic weapon.
This ability improves as the monk rises in levels as follows: +2
at 5th, +3 at 8th, +4 at 12th and +5 at 17th. This ability does
not confer any actual bonus to hit and damage.

<h5 id="monk_slow_fall">SLOW FALL</h5>

At 4th level, a monk’s body control allows
him to slow his fall if within 10 feet of a vertical surface.
By using the wall or surface, the monk breaks his fall and
takes less damage than normal. The damage is reduced as
if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. As the
monk progresses in levels, the damage reduction increases as
follows: 25 feet at 6th level, 30 feet at 9th level, 35 feet at 13th
level, and 40 feet at 18th level.

<h5 id="monk_feign_death">FEIGN DEATH</h5>
At 6th level, a monk has mastery over vital
bodily functions, and can slow them until he or she appears to
be dead. The monk may maintain this state of feigned death for
a number of minutes equal to the character’s level.

<h5 id="monk_fast_healing">FAST HEALING</h5>
At 7th level, a monk’s body naturally heals
faster than normal. Each day, a monk heals 1d4+1 hit point
per level as long as rest, sleep and meditation is possible. The
monk must be in a calm environment, under no physical duress
or mental stress, able to sleep undisturbed for 12 hours, and
generally rest without exertion for another 6 hours. Food and
water should be readily available.

<h5 id="monk_iron_mind">IRON MIND</h5>

At 9th level, a monk gains a +3 bonus to saving
throws against confusion, charm, fear, and spells that affect
the mind. The bonus increases to +4 at 11th level, and +5 at
14th level.

<h5 id="monk_death_strike">DEATH STRIKE</h5>

At 10th level, a monk gains a fearsome
attack capable of dealing death with a single blow. The
monk can use this attack once per week. The attack must be
announced before an attack roll is made. The monk must be
of higher level than the target, or have more levels than the
target’s hit dice. If the monk successfully deals damage with the
attack, the death strike succeeds and unless the victim makes a
constitution check, the victim is immediately slain.
<p>At 12th level, after a successful death strike, the monk can
choose to delay the victim’s death by up to 1 round per
level. The monk merely wills the target to die at any point
within the alloted time. However, if the monk wishes, the
monk need not inflict death on his victim. Instead, the
monk can release the victim from the death sentence upon
a successful touch attack. For example, a 12th level monk
successfully strikes a 5th level fighter. The monk can will the
fighter to die any time within the following twelve rounds.
Or, the monk can release the fighter from the death strike
by a successful touch attack.</p>
<p>The death strike has no effect on undead, oozes, elementals or
creatures that can only be struck by magic weapons, unless the
monk is able to hit the creature with the iron fists ability.</p>
