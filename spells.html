            This spell allows a single target creature to tread on air or
liquid as if walking on solid ground. The caster must choose the
version of the spell desired upon the initial casting of the spell.
<p>Air Walk: The maximum upward or downward angle possible
is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the creature’s normal
movement. A strong wind (21+ mph) can push an air walker
along or hold the walker back. Each round at the end of the
walker’s turn, the wind blows the walker 5 feet for each 5 miles
per hour of wind speed.</p>
<p>Water Walk: The creature’s feet hover an inch above the
surface. Any liquid may be traversed, including mud,
oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava
(although creatures crossing molten lava or other harmful
surfaces still take damage from the heat or other harm). The
creature can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across
the surface as if it were normal ground. If the spell is cast
underwater (or while the subject is partially submerged),
the subject is borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round
until they can stand on it.</p>

The caster summons a small animal to watch over an area.
Each time a creature enters the warded area, a mental or
audible alarm is triggered. Whether the alarm is mental or
audible is left up to the caster but must be decided upon at the
moment the spell is cast. A creature who speaks the password,
also determined at the time of casting, does not set off the
alarm. The caster may elect to have small animals not set off
the alarm. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm
unless the intruder becomes material while in the warded area.
The spell’s area of affect is a 50 ft. diameter circle and requires
a small bell to activate.
<p>Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster so long as
the character remains within a mile of the warded area. It
will also awaken the caster from normal sleep, but does not
otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect
on a mental alarm.</p>
<p>Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a
bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it
clearly. Doors and walls will reduce the distance by 10 to 20 feet.
In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly up to 180
feet. The ringing lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence
spell cannot hear the ringing.</p>

  This spell allows the caster to enlarge or reduce a creature
  or object, increasing or decreasing both size and weight. The
  subject may be altered by up to 10% per caster level, increasing
  by this amount in height, width and depth (to a maximum of
  50%). Alter size affects one creature or one object of up to 10
  cubic ft/lvl in volume.
  <p>Weight increases by approximately the cube of the size increase,
as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>HEIGHT INCREASE</th>

<p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is also changed by
the spell. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth
or reduction, the creature or object attains the maximum
possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process. However,
it is constrained without harm by stronger materials: the spell
cannot be used to crush a creature by its own growth.</p>
<p>Magical properties are not increased by this spell. Weight, mass,
and strength are affected though. A creature’s hit points, armor
class, and to hit bonus do not change, but strength increases
along with size. For every 20% of enlargement, the creature
gains a +1 bonus to strength.</p>

By means of this spell, the caster befriends and wins the loyalty
  of an animal. The spell functions only if the caster actually
  wishes to become the animal’s friend, and uses food to initiate
  the spell. Otherwise the spell fails. The befriended animal’s
  loyalty is natural (not magical) and lasting. The caster can teach
  the befriended animal 3-6 specific tricks or tasks. The tricks or
  tasks cannot be complex, generally mimicking those taught to
  a pet or mount. It takes at least a week for an animal to learn
  each trick.
  <p>  The animal is still an animal. While it may have learned some
    tricks, it is still no more intelligent than any other animal of its kind,
    and it retains all its bestial instincts. Unlike intelligent followers or
    cohorts, animals can’t follow complex instructions. Animals are
    ill-equipped to handle unusual situations, such as combats with
    invisible opponents, and they typically hesitate to attack weird and
    unnatural creatures. Left to its own judgment, an animal follows a
    caster and attacks creatures that attack the caster or that attack
    the animal itself. To do more than that, it needs to learn tricks.
    Some typical tricks or tasks include the following:</p>
<p><b>Attack:</b> The animal attacks apparent enemies. The
  character may point to a particular creature and direct the
  animal to attack that creature. Normally, an animal will not
  attack unnatural creatures (though it will defend people,
  guard places and protect characters against them). Teaching
  an animal to attack unnatural creatures counts as two tricks.</p>
<p><b>Come:</b> The animal comes to the character, even if the animal
normally would not do so such as following the character
onto a boat.</p>
<p><b>Defend:</b> The animal defends the character or is ready to
defend the character if no threat is present.</p>
<p><b>Down:</b> The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise
backs down.</p>
<p><b>Fetch:</b> The animal goes and gets something. The character
must point out a specific object or the animal fetches some
random object.</p>
<p><b>Guard:</b> The animal stays in place and prevents others from
approaching.</p>
<p> <b>Heel:</b> The animal follows the character closely, even to
places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
<p><b>Perform:</b> The animal does a variety of simple tricks like
sitting up, rolling over, roaring and so on. Each of these must
be taught separately.</p>
<p><b>Protect:</b> The animal follows a specific character and protects
them.</p>
<p><b>Seek:</b> The animal moves into an area and looks around for
anything unusual.</p>
<p><b>Stay:</b> The animal stays in place waiting for the character to
return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,
though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
<p><b>Track:</b> The animal tracks the scent presented to it.
</p>
<p>A caster can have more than one animal friend, but their hit
dice can total no more than twice the caster’s level. A caster
may dismiss animal friends to befriend new ones.</p>
<p>If the caster spends most of her time in the animals’ home
territory and treats them well, the caster can approach and
maintain the maximum hit dice allowed. If the caster spends
most of the time at sea, in cities or otherwise in places that
the animals don’t like, the animals desert or will return to their
native lands, and the caster will not be able to retain even half
the maximum hit dice. Remember, these creatures are loyal
friends but are not pets or servants. They won’t remain loyal if
being the caster’s friend becomes too onerous.</p>

  The caster causes up to a maximum of eight animals to grow to
twice their normal size. This doubles each animal’s height, length,
and width, increasing its weight by a factor of eight. The increase in
size has a number of effects. The animal’s HD doubles, increasing
the animal’s bonus to hit and saving throws accordingly. The
increase in size increase the damage the animal delivers by onethird.
It also doubles the animal’s constitution bonus. When the
spell ends, the animal’s HP return to normal, and all damage taken
while enlarged is divided by 2. The spell gives the character no
special means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Thus, the spell is often combined with speak with animals and a
charm spell. Animal growth has a 25 x 25 foot area of effect.

  Using food to initiate the spell the caster compels a small
  animal to go to a spot the caster designates. The spell has no
  effect on an animal tamed, trained or under the influence of
  someone else. The caster can mentally impress on the animal a
  certain place well known to the caster or an obvious landmark.
  The directions must be simple, as the animal depends on the
  caster’s knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own.
  The caster can attach a small item or note to the messenger.
  The animal travels to the location and waits there until the
  spell expires. During the period of waiting, the animal allows
  others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
  The intended recipient of a message gains no special ability to
  communicate with the animal or read any attached message.

The caster polymorphs up to one willing creature per level,
  in a 25 x 25 foot area, into a small or medium animal of the
  caster’s choice. Recipients remain in the animal form until the
  spell expires or the caster dismisses the spell. The caster can
  designate the new form’s physical qualities (such as hair color,
  hair texture, skin color, height, weight and gender), but all must
  fall within the norms for the species.
<p>Upon changing into an animal, a subject regains lost hit points
  as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not
  restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of
  resting for a day). Further, the polymorphed subject acquires the
  physical and natural abilities of the animal while retaining its
  own mind. In general, the subject’s new scores and faculties are
  average ones for the species into which it has been transformed.
  Natural abilities include armor class (if better), attack routines
  and damage, movement capabilities such as walking, swimming
  and flight, and extraordinary vision. The subject does not gain
  any extraordinary abilities of the animal.</p>
<p>  The subject retains its prime attributes, intelligence, wisdom and
  charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change
  in its constitution modifier), alignment and attack bonus. The
  subject can cast spells for which it has components. When the
  polymorph occurs, however, the subject’s equipment, if any,
  melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional; material
  components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to
  cast spells. A humanlike voice is required for verbal components,
  and humanlike hands are require for somatic components.</p>

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures in a 25
  x 25 feet area into undead skeletons or zombies that follow
  the caster’s spoken commands. The undead can follow the
  caster, or can remain in an area and attack any creature or
  specific type of creature entering the area. The undead remain
  animated until they are destroyed. Destroyed undead can’t be
  animated again. Regardless of the type of undead, the caster
  can’t create more HD of undead than the caster has levels in
  any single casting of the spell.
  <p>  The undead remain under the caster’s control indefinitely. No
    matter how many times the caster uses this spell, however, the
    character can only control 2 HD worth of undead creatures
    per caster level. If the caster exceeds this number, all the newly
    created creatures fall under the caster’s control, and any excess
    undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (the
    character chooses which creatures are released). If the caster is
    a cleric, any undead the character might command by virtue of
    the caster’s power to command or rebuke undead, do not count
    toward the spell’s limits.</p>
<p>  A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or
  skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made
  from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. A zombie, however,
  can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The statistics
  for skeletons and zombies are detailed in Monsters & Treasure;
  undead created with this spell do not retain any abilities the
  creature may have had while alive.</p>
  <p><i>Preserve Dead:</i> This reverse version may only be cast by divine
  spellcasters, and has two effects. First, the caster preserves the
  remains of the target corpses so that they do not decay, for one
  day per level of the caster. Doing so extends the time limit on
  raising that creature from the dead. The spell works on severed
  body parts and the like. Second, the spell permanently prevents
  the target corpses from being animated by an animate dead spell.
  If a target corpse is preserved, and then raised from the dead or
  resurrected, the spell ends.</p>

  By means of this spell or its reverse variation, the caster causes
  one location or one object to emanate magical vibrations
  that repel or attract a specific order of intelligent creature or
  creatures of a particular alignment. The creature to be affected
  must be named specifically and defined by the caster during the
  casting of the spell; larger groups, such as a type or subtype,
  are not specific enough. Alternatively, a specific alignment can
  be named. For example, the caster could specify zombies, but
  not undead; alternatively, the caster could specify neutral evil
  creatures. This spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
  <p>If the spell is cast upon a location, the area affected is a 10 foot
  square area per level of the caster. If the spell is cast upon an
  object, only the object is affected. Casting the spell requires at
  least 1,500 gp worth of gems or jewelry.</p>
  <p> <i>Antipathy</i> The spell emanates eldritch vibrations that repel
  specified creatures, forcing them to abandon the area or item.
  The creatures will not willingly return while the spell is in effect.
  A creature which makes a successful saving throw can stay in the
  area or touch the item, but feels hesitant and very uncomfortable
  doing so. This discomfort, while in effect, reduces the creature’s
  charisma by 4 points. Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy.</p>
  <p> <i>Sympathy</i> The reverse of the spell causes designated creatures to
  feel elated and pleased to be in the area, or desire to touch or to
  possess the object. The compulsion is overpowering. If the save
  is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment,
  but a subsequent save must be made every hour if the creature
  remains in the area or within the presence of the item (within
  10 feet per level of the caster). If a subsequent save fails, the
  affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.
  Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.</p>

  The caster creates an invisible magical eye that sends the caster
  visual information. The arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round,
  and sees exactly as the caster would see if the caster were there. If
  the eye examines walls or ceilings, it moves at 10 feet per round.
  Solid barriers prevent the passage of an arcane eye, although it
  can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole
  (one inch in diameter). The caster must concentrate to use the
  eye. If the caster does not concentrate, the eye becomes inert
  until the caster again concentrates.

<p> The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells
or items (though the caster can use magic to improve the
caster’s own eyesight). The caster is subject to any gaze
attack the eye encounters. A successful dispel magic cast
on the caster or the eye ends the spell. With respect to
blindness, magical darkness and other phenomena that
affect vision, the arcane eye is considered an independent
sensory organ of the caster (including a creature). Creatures
with intelligence 12 or higher can sense the arcane eye by
making an intelligence check. Spells such as detect scrying
can also detect the eye.</p>

  This spell frees the spirit from the body, allowing the caster to
  project an astral body into another plane. The caster can bring
  the astral forms of other creatures as well, provided the creatures
  are linked in a circle with the caster at the time of the casting.
  These fellow travelers must accompany the caster at all times
  to remain in an astral state. If something happens to the caster
  during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever the
  caster left them. The caster can bring one additional creature
  for every two levels of experience.
<p>The bodies of the caster and companions are left behind, in a
state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy
of them and all they wear or carry onto the astral plane. Because
the astral plane touches upon other planes, the caster can travel
astrally to any of these other planes as the caster wishes. The
caster then leaves the astral plane, forming a new physical
body (and equipment) on the plane of existence the caster has
chosen to enter.</p>
<p>When on the astral plane or another plane, the caster’s astral
body is connected at all times to the caster’s material body by
a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the caster is killed both
astrally and materially. Very few things can destroy a silver
cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the
incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new
body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord
simply returns to the caster’s original body, reviving it from its
state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are
able to function on the astral plane, their actions affect only
creatures existing on the astral plane.</p>
<p>The caster and the caster’s companions may travel through the
astral plane indefinitely. The spell lasts until the caster desires to
end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as
dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form,
or the destruction of the caster’s body (which kills the caster).</p>

  This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from
  the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly
  repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. The spell
  removes the burden from a creature who committed the evil
  act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion. A suitable
  focus worth at least 500 gp and ceremonial components totaling
  100gp in cost are needed to cast the spell.
  <p>It may also be used to atone a creature who committed deliberate
misdeeds and acts of a knowing and wilful nature. In such cases,
the caster’s deity becomes directly involved in the atonement.
Such intercession has a debilitating effect on the caster. Upon
completion of the spell, the caster loses all spell casting ability for
one week and must rest for one day before resuming normal, daily
activity. Many casters first assign the atoning subject a quest or
similar penance before casting the atonement spell on their behalf.</p>

<p>Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes:</p>
<p> <b>Reverse Magical Alignment Change:</b>If a creature has
had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its
alignment to its original status.</p>
<p> <b>Restore Class or Abilities:</b>
A paladin who has lost paladin
class features due to unwillingly or unwittingly committing
an evil act may have paladinhood restored by this spell. A
paladin who willingly and deliberately commits an evil act
will not be restored. A cleric or druid who has lost the ability
to cast spells because the caster incurred the anger of their
deity may regain spell powers by seeking atonement from
another cleric of the same deity, or in the case of a druid,
another druid.</p>

<p> <b>Redemption or Temptation</b>
  The caster may cast this spell
  upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it
  a chance to change its alignment to match the caster’s. The
  subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon
  the spell’s completion, the subject freely chooses whether
  it retains its original alignment or changes to the caster’s
  alignment. No duress, compulsion or magical influence can
  force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered
if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the
spell does not work on outsiders (or any creature incapable of
changing its alignment naturally).

  By using a suitable focus worth at least 25gp an augury can tell
  the caster whether a particular action will bring good or bad
  results for the caster in the immediate future. The base chance
  for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level;
  the Castle Keeper makes the roll secretly. The Castle Keeper
  may determine that the question is so straightforward that a
  successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance
  of success. If the augury succeeds, the caster gets one of four
  results: (1) Weal (if the action will probably bring good results),
  (2) Woe (for bad results), (3) Weal and woe (for both), or (4)
  Nothing (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad
  results). If the spell fails, the caster gets the nothing result. A
  cleric who gets the nothing result has no way to tell whether it
  resulted from a failed or successful augury.
<p>The augury can see into the future only about half an hour,
so anything that might happen after that does not affect the
augury. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the
contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person upon
the same topic use the same dice result as the first augury.</p>

  Banishment enables the caster to force extraplanar creatures
  within a 25 x 25 foot area, back to their home plane. Up to 2
  hit dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. To target
  a creature, the character must present at least one object or

  such object or substance, the creature suffers a -2 penalty on

  There are two versions of this spell. The caster chooses one
  when the spell is cast.

  <p><b>Barkskin armor: </b>This version grants a +3 bonus to AC due
  to the toughening of the caster’s skin. This bonus increases to
  +4 at 6th level and to +5 at 12th level and higher.</p>

  <p><b>Tree Shape:</b> This version causes the caster to assume the form
    of a small, living tree or shrub; or a large, dead tree trunk with
    a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal
    that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed
    creature. To all normal tests the caster is, in fact, a tree or
    shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint magic upon
    the tree. While in tree form, the caster can observe all that
    transpires nearby just as if the caster were in the caster’s
    normal form, and the caster’s hit points and saves remain
    unaffected. The caster gains a +10 bonus to AC but loses
    any dexterity bonus to armor class (effective dexterity score of
    one). All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with the
    character. The caster can dismiss the tree shape at any time.</p>

  Upon casting this spell, the wizard forcibly transports a powerful
  elemental from one of the elemental planes to the plane in
  which the caster is located. The type of elemental summoned
  must be designated by the caster before the spell is begun. As
  the elemental will be a large specimen of 12 HD, fire and water
  elementals will require a large source of either element in order
  to be able to take shape. Earth and air are typically present in
  abundance. The caster can use any time which can reasonably
  be associated with the element being summoned.

  <p>The elemental does not come willingly, nor will it do the
caster’s bidding without a struggle. The caster must maintain
concentration upon the elemental to force it to serve. If the
caster moves, speaks, takes damage, or performs any other
action other than concentrating on forcing the elemental to do
his or her bidding, the elemental attacks the caster immediately,
and will not stop until destroyed. Control over the elemental
cannot be regained. It will ignore any and all opponents save
for the wizard who summoned it. The caster may release the
elemental at any time.</p>

  A binding spell creates a magical restraint, o convinces the
  recipient that such a restraint exists, to hold a creature. The
  target only gets an initial saving throw if its HD is equal to at
  least half the caster’s level. The caster may employ up to six
  assistants with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion,
  the caster’s effective caster level increases by +1. For each
  assistant who casts a charm or other appropriate spell, the
  caster’s effective level increases by +2 (provided the target
  is appropriate for the spell). All the assistants must join in
  chanting the spell as detailed below.

  <p>The binding spell has six versions. The caster chooses one when
the spell is cast. Regardless of the version cast, the caster can
specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the
creature whenever they occur. These can be as simple or elaborate
as the caster desires (subject to the Castle Keeper agreeing that
the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to
pass). The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity
or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions
or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD or HPs do not
qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot
be changed. Setting a release condition results in a saving throw
penalty of -2, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p>A creature may only be subject to one binding spell at a time.
Additional binding spells cast on a subject already bound have
no effect.</p>

<p><b>Chaining:</b>The subject is confined by restraints that generate
an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the
subject except the caster. Duration is one year per caster
level. The subject is confined to the spot it occupied when it
became subject to the spell’s effect.</p>

<p><b>Slumber:</b> Imposes a comatose sleep upon the subject for up to
one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or
drink while slumbering, nor does it age. Saves are made at +1.</p>

<p><b>Bound Slumber:</b> A combination of chaining and slumber
that lasts for up to one month per caster level. Saves are made
at +3, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Hedged Prison:</b>The subject is transported to or otherwise
brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander
by any means. The spell is permanent. Saves are made at +4,
if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Metamorphosis: </b>The subject assumes gaseous form, except
for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other
container, which may be transparent. The creature remains
aware of its surroundings and can speak, but cannot leave
the container, attack or use any of its powers or abilities. The
binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe,
eat or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Saves are
made at +5, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Minimus Containment:</b>The subject is shrunk to a height
of one inch or less and held within some gem or similar object
or jar. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need
to breathe, eat or drink while contained, nor does it age.
Saves are made at +4, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

  This spell rapidly cycles the caster in and out of existence (into
  the ethereal plane). Blinking has several effects. Attacks against
  the caster are made at -10. If the attacker, however, is capable
  of striking ethereal or incorporeal creatures, or is able to see
  invisible creatures, then attacks are made at only -2. If the
  attacker can both see and strike ethereal creatures, the attacker
  suffers no penalty. Individually targeted spells have a 50%
  chance to fail against the character while blinking unless the
  attacker can target invisible or ethereal creatures. Area attacks,
such as dragon’s breath or fireball, cause full damage.

<p>The caster’s own attacks are made at -2. Likewise, the caster’s
own spells have a 50% chance to activate just as the character
goes ethereal, in which case they take effect on the ethereal
plane. Since the character spends about half the character’s
time on the ethereal plane, the character can see and even
attack ethereal creatures. The character interacts with ethereal
creatures roughly the same way the character interacts with
material ones.</p>

<p>While blinking, the character can step through, but not see
through, solid objects no more than 5 feet thick. If the caster
attempts to walk through material thicker than 5 feet, they
blink into the solid object, the spell ends, and they are shunted
off to the nearest open space, suffering 1d6 points of damage per
5 feet traveled through solid matter.</p>

  Clairaudience or clairvoyance enables the character to concentrate

  This spell creates a duplicate of a creature. To create the duplicate,
  the caster must spend 5000gp for research and creation and must
  have a piece of flesh taken from the original’s living body, with
  a volume of at least one cubic inch. The piece of flesh need not
  be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast,

  A bank of yellowish-green poisonous fog billows out from the
  point the caster designates and affects a 20 foot high x 30 foot
  wide x 20 foot thick area. The fog obscures all sight, including
  extraordinary vision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet
  has one-half concealment. Creatures farther away have total
  concealment. The fog’s vapors kill any living creature with 3
  or fewer HD (no save) and causes creatures with 4 to 6 HD
  to make constitution saving throws or die. Living creatures
  above 6 HD, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD who make their saving
  throws, take 1d10 points of poison damage each round while
  in the cloud. Holding one’s breath doesn’t help unfortunately.

  <p>The cloud moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round, rolling
along the surface of the ground. Because the vapors are heavier than
air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down
openings. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four
rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in one round.</p>

  A rainbow cone springs forth from the caster’s hand, causing
nearby creatures to fall asleep. The spell can affect a number
of creatures equal to 1d4 plus the caster’s level. The cone is 5
feet wide and 25 feet long. The closest creatures in the cone are
affected first.

The result of the spell depends upon the HD of the targeted
creatures. Creatures of 2 HD or less are struck unconscious for 2d4
rounds; creatures of 3 to 4 HD are blinded for 1d4 rounds; and
creatures of 5 HD or greater are stunned for one round. Creatures

  The caster utters a one-word directive, which the subject or
subjects, up to one creature for every 2 levels, obeys to the best
of their ability unless they make a charisma saving throw. The
command must be clear and understood by the targeted creature.
A command of “die” causes the subject to fall unconscious
for the duration of the spell, whereas a command of
“suicide” would fail because it is generally used as a noun,
not as a command. A command of “awake” will counter magically

  The caster causes plants, fungi and plant creatures to do the
character’s bidding with a 50 foot diameter circle. There are
three versions of the spell described below.

<p> <b>Animate:</b> The spell imbues trees or other large, inanimate
vegetable life with mobility. The animated plants then attack
whomever or whatever the character first designates. Animated
plants gain humanlike senses. The plants’ armor class, attacks
and special abilities vary with their size and form, as described
for animated objects. The character can animate two trees, four
shrubs or eight vines. All plants to be affected must be within
50 feet of each other. The character can animate different types
of plants if desired. The effect lasts one hour per caster level.</p>

<p><b>Charm: </b>Against plant and fungus creatures, command
plants functions in the same manner as a mass charm spell.
The character can command a number of plant creatures
whose combined level or HD do not exceed three times the
character’s level. No two affected creatures can be more than
25 feet from each other, and each is allowed a charisma saving
throw. The effect lasts 1 day per caster level.</p>

<p><b>Enhanced Entangle:</b>This version acts as an enhanced
entangle spell, allowing all plants within the area of effect to
entwine about any creatures within, or moving through the
area, holding them fast. A successful dexterity save means
that the creature manages to avoided becoming entangled
for that particular round. An entangled creature suffers a -2
penalty to attack, a -4 penalty to effective dexterity, and also
cannot move, making the casting of a spells with a somatic
component impossible. Breaking free requires a successful
strength check. Each round, the plants once again attempt
to entangle all creatures who have avoided or escaped
entanglement. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from
being entangled. Plants can also free creatures trapped by an
entangle spell. The effect lasts one hour per caster level. </p>

  The caster can attempt to contact the character’s deity or
  agents and ask questions that can be answered by a simple
  yes or no answer. A cleric with no particular deity contacts a
  philosophically allied deity. This spell should be used sparingly,
  as disfavor could be gained with frequent use. The caster needs
  incense, holy symbol or other religious items.

  The caster is allowed one question per caster level. The answers
  given are correct within the limits of the deity’s knowledge. Any
  question that cannot be answered with yes or no will result in
  no answer and will count against the caster’s maximum number
  of questions. If a caster doesn’t focus on the conversation, such
  as discussing answers with others, the deity becomes angry or
  irritated, and ends the spell.

  The caster projects his mind to another plane of existence in
  hopes of receiving advice and information from powers that
  reside there. The powers reply in a language the character
  understands, or by telepathy, but they often resent such contact
  and as a result give brief answers. The Castle Keeper will answers
  questions with yes, no, maybe, never, unclear, irrelevant or some
  other one-word answer.
  <p>The character must concentrate to maintain the spell, and may
    ask one question per round. The question is answered during
    the same round. A caster may ask one question for every two
    caster levels. Upon first making contact, the caster must make
    an intelligence saving throw. Failure results in the spell ending
    immediately, and the caster suffering an attribute loss and
    possible insanity as indicated on the table below.</p>
<p>  The caster can contact an elemental plane or some plane
  further removed. Contact with a mind far removed from the
  caster’s home plane increases the likelihood of a successful
  answer, but likewise increases the probability that the caster
  will suffer adverse effects. On rare occasions, this form of
  divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or
  forces. The following table shows the possible consequences
  and results of the attempt.</p>

  <p> <b>Failed Saving Throw: </b>If the caster fails an intelligence
save against the indicated CL, the caster’s intelligence and
charisma scores are decreased as indicated on the table below
for one week’s duration. Lowering of intelligence can result
in the loss of bonus spells, and if reduced to 8 or less, the
loss of daily spells entirely. Additionally, the caster may go
insane when contacting a plane other than an elemental
plane. A saving throw failed by 5 or more results in insanity
in the caster. A saving throw roll of natural 1 always results in
insanity. Insanity lasts as follows:</p>

<p>Astral:1 week</p>
<p>Demigod: 1d4 weeks</p>
<p>Lesser Deity: 2d4 weeks </p>
<p>Greater Deity: 3d4 weeks</p>

<p> <b>Results of a Successful Contact:</b>The Castle Keeper rolls
D% to generate the result shown on the table:</p>
<p><b>True Answer: </b>The character gets a true, one-word answer.
Questions not capable of being answered in this way are
answered as unclear.</p>
<p><b>Don’t Know: </b>The entity tells the character that it doesn’t know.</p>
<p><b>Lie: </b>The entity intentionally lies to the character.</p>
<p><b>Random Answer: </b>The entity tries to lie but doesn’t know
the answer, so it makes one up.</p>

  This spell allows the caster to control and to converse, in
  very rudimentary terms, with all sorts of plants and plantlike
  creatures (including fungi, molds and plantlike monsters) in
  a 25 foot x 25 foot area. The caster automatically exercises
  limited control over normal plants, but plantlike creatures can
  negate the control effect with a charisma save. The spell does
  not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but
  it does allow them to move their branches, stems and leaves.
  The plants can duplicate the effect of an entangle spell, or free
  creatures trapped by that spell.

The spell allows the caster to either raise or lower water.

<p> <b>Lower Water:</b>This use of the spell causes water (or any similar
liquid) to sink away to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The depth
can be lowered by up to 2 feet per caster level. The water
is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up
to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep
bodies of water, a powerful caster can create a whirlpool that
sweeps ships downward, putting them at risk of damage and
rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the
duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and
other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell. The
spell has no effect on other creatures.</p>

<p> <b>Raise Water:</b>This use of the spell causes water (or any similar
liquid) to rise in height. Boats raised in this way slide down the
sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the
spell is adjacent to land, the water can spill over onto dry land.</p>

  The caster changes the weather in the local area, 2 miles x 2
  miles centered on caster. The caster can only call forth weather
  appropriate to the climate and season of the area, but can
  almost always change the direction of the wind and control its
  intensity from calm to strong. The character cannot control
  the specific applications of the weather. When the character
  selects a certain weather condition to occur, the weather
  assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually).
  The weather continues as the caster left it for the duration,
  or until the character designates a new kind of weather. Each
  change in weather by the caster takes 10 minutes to manafest.
  Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
  Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena
  (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. Druids
  casting this spell double the duration and range.

  The caster alters wind force in a 100 foot diameter sphere/level,
  centered on the caster. The caster can make the wind blow
  in a certain direction or manner, and increase or decrease its
  strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the
  spell ends or the caster chooses to alter the spell, which requires
  concentration. The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to
  50 feet in diameter at the center of the area if the character so
  desires, and the character may choose to limit the effect to any
  area less than the spell’s full area of effect.
  <p> <b>Wind Direction: </b>The caster may choose one of four basic wind
patterns to function over the spell’s area: a downdraft blows
from the center outward in equal strength in all directions;
an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center
in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before
impinging on the eye in the center; a rotation causes the winds
to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion;
a blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across
the entire area from one side to the other.</p>
<p> <b>Wind Force: </b>For every three caster levels, the character can
increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength.
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe
wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from
the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden
structures, tears off roofs and endangers ships. Hurricane
force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes
uproot even large trees and cause most ships to founder. A
tornado (175+ mph) destroys all non fortified buildings and
often uproots large trees.</p>

  The caster calls forth a mass of 1,000 venomous, biting and

  carpetlike mass swarms in a square 25 feet on a side. Upon the
  caster’s command, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round
  toward any prey within 150 feet. Each vermin in the creeping
  doom effect automatically bites a creature for 1 point of damage
  and then dies. Each creature overrun by the swarm takes
  enough hit points of damage to kill it, destroying that number
  of vermin in the process. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all
  the creatures in the spell’s effect, damage is distributed among
  the survivors equally. If the creeping doom travels more than
  100 feet away from the character, it loses 50 of its number for
  each additional 10 feet it travels. Anything that would deter or
  destroy normal insects is effective against these insects.

  This spell causes an object or surface to radiate darkness out to

  foot radius. Creatures that suffer penalties in bright light suffer
  them while exposed to this magical light. Darkness and daylight
  cancel each other out, leaving whatever light conditions
  normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells. Higherlevel
  light spells are not affected by darkness, and the reverse
  is true for daylight. If either spell is cast on a small object that
  is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell’s
  effects are blocked until the covering is removed.</p>

  This spell is an enhanced version of fireball, except the caster
  can choose to delay the detonation. With a gesture, the caster
  sends a small ball of fire hurtling through the air to detonate
  with a low roar at the height and distance the caster desires as
  long as it is within the spell’s maximum range. The explosion fills
  the area of effect, a 40 foot diameter sphere, with intense fire
  and heat, causing 1d6 +1 per level fire damage to all creatures
  and objects within the area. It ignites combustibles and damages
  objects, and melts anything with a low melting point such as
  bronze, copper, silver, lead or gold. The explosion creates almost
  no pressure. A small lump of coal is required to cast the spell.
<p>The fireball can detonate immediately in the same round that
the spell is cast, or the caster can choose to delay the explosion
for up to 5 rounds. The caster chooses the amount of delay upon
completing the spell, and the delay cannot be changed once it
has been set.</p>
<p>Unlike the fireball spell, impact against a solid barrier does not
  cause early detonation. If the caster chooses a delayed blast, the
  glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature
  can pick up and hurl the fireball like a rock. If the caster attempts
  to send the ball through a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit,
  the character must hit with a ranged attack roll, or else the bead
  strikes the barrier and falls to a resting point until detonation.</p>

  By means of this spell, the caster can sense the presence of

  the caster. The strength of each aspect’s aura will be revealed as

  lose all spell-casting abilities. The abilities cannot be recovered
by mortal magic, nor even by a wish. Destroying artifacts is a
dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention
of some powerful being who has an interest in, or connection
with, the device. When casting the spell at an anti-magic field,
the caster has a 1% chance per caster level of destroying it. If
the anti-magic field survives the disjunction, the items within it
are unaffected by the spell.

  Colored energy surrounds the caster, shielding them against

  This spell ends ongoing spells and spell-like effects that have been
  cast on a creature or object, temporarily suppresses the magical
  abilities of a magic item or counters another spellcaster’s spell
  within an area 30 feet x 30 feet x 30 feet. The caster must make
  a successful intelligence check against each spell, effect, object or
  creature in the area of effect to succeed. Some spells, as detailed

  of spells with instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because

items is suppressed for 1d4 rounds, but artifacts are unaffected.
Inter-dimensional portals close for a number of rounds equal

maintained by an ongoing spell, such as a summoned monster,
is sent back to whence it came, because the spell that conjured
it ends. If an ongoing spell’s area overlaps that of the dispel,
the effect is ended only within the area of the dispel magic. The
caster automatically succeeds at the dispel check against their
own spells as long as the character is of the same or higher level

  creating the illusion. The spell may duplicate the effects of any

  This spell provides the caster with a useful piece of advice in reply
  to a question concerning a specific goal, event or activity that is
  to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short
  phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic riddle or omen. The
  Castle Keeper controls what information the character receives.
  It should be noted that if the caster’s party doesn’t act on the
  information, the conditions may change so that the information
  is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is
  70% + 1% per caster level. The Castle Keeper adjusts the chance
  if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual
  precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the
  die roll fails, the character knows the spell failed, unless specific
  magic yielding false information is at work. Multiple divinations
  about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as
  the first divination and yield the same answer each time.

  The dreaming is a powerful dweomer in which the illusionist
  places the victim into a comatose dream state and then
  enters the victim’s dreams, and if the illusionist wishes, attack
  the victim in his dreams or seek out hidden knowledge and
  secrets. The illusionist must make a successful touch attack
  for the spell to take effect. The victim is not allowed a saving
  throw. If the touch attack is successful, the victim’s body
  becomes comatose while the victim’s mind wanders through
  the creature’s dreams and nightmares. The victim does not
  believe they are in a dream, but instead believes they are
  awake and experiencing reality.
  <p>Once the illusionist has placed the victim in a comatose state,
  the illusionist has two options. The more powerful option
  requires the illusionist to keep touching the victim so as to
  successfully manipulate the magical dreams.</p>
  <p>If the illusionist ceases to touch the victim, the victim will
    remain comatose and unable to act or interact with anyone
    in any way until the spell ends or until they are successfully
    awakened by another. The victim can only be awakened if
    struck with a force that causes damage. If so struck, the victim
    is allowed an intelligence saving throw to awaken and come out
    of the dreaming.</p>
  <p>If the illusionist, however, has continued to touch the victim
since the spell began, then the victim cannot be awakened.
Instead, the illusionist convinces the victim that they have
awakened into a dream and then they slip back into a comatose
state.</p>
<p>  While continuing to touch the victim, the illusionist also can
  assault the victim’s mind with deadly attacks that cause damage
  or seek out information. The illusionist does so by casting spells
  into the dream. The spells are limited to those with verbal and/
  or somatic components only. If such a spell deals damage or
  death, the victim is allowed a normal saving throw to resist the
  spell’s effect. If the spell seeks information from the victim, which
  typically will require both the spell and role playing the dream
  encounter, the victim suffers a -6 to any allowed saving throw.</p>

  Drawing upon elemental forces, this spell creates an intense
  but highly localized tremor, within a 50 foot diameter circle,
  that ripples the ground, knocking creatures down, collapsing
  structures, and opening gaping fissures. The earthquake affects
  standing creatures in its area in a variety of ways.
  <p>All creatures standing in the area must make a dexterity save or
fall down. Even if they remain standing, they suffer a -10 penalty
to any actions attempted during the spell’s duration, and find it
impossible to move at more than half their normal speed, if at
all. All spellcasters standing in the area find it impossible to cast
spells while the earthquake is in effect, and lose any spells they
were in the process of casting.</p>
<p>Fissures rip open in the ground without warning, with a 25%
chance of opening beneath each creature in the area. Such
creatures must make dexterity saves to avoid falling into the
fissure, taking 1d6 damage if they fail. The worse threat, however,
is that all such fissures grind shut with impossible force at the end
of the round, crushing any trapped creatures to death.</p>

<p>The earthquake also has additional effects based on the terrain
it effects:</p>

<p> <b>Cave or Tunnel:</b> The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 damage to
any creature caught under the cave-in (dexterity save, half).</p>
<p> <b>Cliffs: </b>The cliff crumbles, causing a landslide that travels as
far horizontally as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the
top of a 100 foot cliff would sweep 100 foot outward from
the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path of the landslide
suffers 8d6 damage (dexterity save, half).</p>
<p> <b>River, Lake, or Marsh:</b> Fissures open underneath the
water, draining it away from the area to form a quagmire.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the
duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
All creatures in the area must make dexterity saves or sink
down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell,
the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained
water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>
<p> <b>Structure:</b> Most structures standing on open ground
collapse, dealing 8d6 damage to those caught in or beneath
the rubble (dexterity save, half).</p>

  This spell induces a powerful emotion in the hearts and minds
  of the creatures it effects, eclipsing their natural feelings. It
  affects a 25 foot x 25 foot area.
  <p>The caster may choose which emotion to inflict:</p>
<p> <b>Despair:</b> A lack of all hope crushes the targeted creatures’
morale. They suffer a -2 penalty to all saves, attacks, attribute
checks, ability checks and damage rolls. Despair dispels Hate.</p>
  <p> <b>Fear:</b> Fear of the caster grips the hearts of the targeted
  creatures. They flee as if subject to a fear spell. Fear dispels Rage.</p>
  <p> <b>Hate: </b>Fiery hate and bile rise in the targeted creatures.
  They react poorly to others and may become antagonistic
  or hostile. They gain a +2 bonus to saves, attacks, attribute
checks, ability checks and damage rolls. Hate dispels Despair.</p>
<p><b>Rage:</b> Sheer blind fury and wrath engulfs the targeted
creatures, and they are compelled to fight, heedless of danger.
They gain a +2 bonus to strength and constitution scores,
and a +1 bonus to saves against fear, but suffer a -1 penalty to
armor class. Rage dispels Fear.</p>

  them to attempt to intertwine about and entangle any creature
  within, or moving through, their location, holding them fast.
  A successful dexterity save means that the creature manages
  to avoid becoming entangled for that particular round. An
  entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack, a -4 penalty
  to effective dexterity, and cannot move, making the casting
  of spells with a somatic component impossible. Breaking free
  requires a successful strength check. Each round, the plants
  once again attempt to entangle all creatures who have avoided
  or escaped entanglement. Area of effect is a 50’ diameter circle.

may pass through all material objects in the material world
without impediment, and may not be seen or interacted with by

off to the nearest open space, taking 1d6 damage per 5 ft. they were

  This spell allows the caster to inscribe innocuous-looking runes
  which detonate when they are read. The spell is used to protect
  and prevent access to a book, map, scroll, or similar object
  containing written information. When read, the runes explode
  causing 6d6 points of damage to the reader. The reader receives
  no saving throw. Creatures and objects within 10 feet of the
  blast must make a dexterity saving throw and suffer only half
  damage if successful. The book or other object upon which the
  runes are written also takes damage, and may be utterly ruined
  in the absence of some protection from magical fire.

<p>The caster, along with anyone else the caster chooses to specify,
may read the runes without triggering them. The caster can
also remove the runes at any time. Otherwise, the runes are
permanent until triggered or removed by dispel magic or other
counterspell.</p>

  Arcane energy forms into a phantom hound dedicated to
  guarding an area or the caster. The caster may order the
  hound to do either at any time during the spell’s duration.
  The hound will consider party members as allies unless
  ordered otherwise. Should a larger creature approach within
  50 feet, the hound immediately lets out a frightful and eerie
  howl. Those hearing the howl must save versus fear or suffer
  a -2 to attacks and morale. This also effects allies of the
  caster. If an intruder approaches to within 10 feet of the
  hound or caster, the guard dog ceases barking and attacks
  with a vicious bite. The hound’s bite is considered a magical
  weapon, and it attacks once per round. The hound gains a
  bonus to hit equal to the caster’s level, and it deals 2d6+3
  damage upon a successful bite. It continues to attack until
  the intruder retreats at least 25 feet away.
  <p>The most effective way to combat the hound is by dispelling it,
but it can be hurt by magic and weapons. The hound has an
armor class of 18 and as many hit points as the caster did when
the spell was cast. If the caster is ever more than 150 feet from the
hound, the spell ends. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level,
but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per level.</p>

  With a gesture, the caster sends a small ball of fire hurtling
  through the air to detonate with a low roar at the height and
  distance the caster desires, as long as it is within the spell’s
  maximum range. The explosion fills the area of effect with
  intense fire and heat, causing 1d6 damage per caster level to all
  creatures and objects within the area. It ignites combustibles,
  damages objects and melts anything with a low melting point
  such as bronze, copper, silver, lead or gold. The explosion
  creates almost no pressure. It affects a 40 foot diameter sphere.
  The material component is a small lump of coal.
  <p>The fireball follows a straight path, and if it impacts a solid
barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, the impact causes
early detonation. If the caster attempts to send the ball through
a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit, the character must hit
with a ranged attack roll, or else the bead strikes the barrier and
detonates prematurely.</p>

<div class="inner_box">
<p style="margin-left: 3px; margin-top: 3px;">
  A shimmering, mystical gate appears, hovering just above the ground.
  The gate is an inter-dimensional portal between the plane the caster
  is on and another plane of existence. The caster chooses which plane
  to connect to upon casting the spell, but must have some knowledge
  of the other plane. The gate can be used in two ways.
  <p>First, the gate may be used as a means of travel. Anything or
anyone moving through the gate instantly transports to the
other plane. The gate is 5 feet in diameter, but the caster can
increase the diameter by 1 foot per level. The caster may hold
the gate open for no more than 1 round per level, and must
concentrate to do so.</p>
<p>Second, the gate may be used to summon an individual
creature or type of creature from the plane to which the gate
is connected. The caster names the creature individually
or a specific creature type upon casting, and the gate opens
near the individual or creature. This spell does not give the
caster any control over creatures summoned through the gate.
The actions of a summoned creature vary depending upon
the situation, the caster’s motive, alignment and perhaps,
additional spells that may be active. Deities and other unique
entities are under no compulsion to come through the gate
unless they choose to. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases,
often to the detriment of the caster, and may return to its home
plane at any time. When used in this manner, the gate remains
open only until the summoned creature(s) passes through the
gate. Neither the caster nor anyone or anything on the caster’s
plane may enter the gate.</p>
<p>Typically, the caster will ask a summoned creature to perform a
service. It is easier to gain service from creatures weaker than the
caster. Deities and beings with a strong will are often ill-disposed
toward the caster for interfering with their life’s activities.</p>
<p>Even if a service is given, the creature may return to its home
plane, at will, whether the service is completed or not, unless
the caster has used some other spell to bind the creature and
force servitude. Contractual service is entirely more involved,
but more likely beneficial for the caster, because the summoned
creature is less likely to be ill disposed towards its summoner
when some form of recompense is offered. The negotiation of a
contract must be roleplayed, bearing in mind the nature of the
creature, its desires, and its intellect; few such creatures have
any need for gold or coin, and their desires may seem alien at
best, or utterly vile. Some creatures may attempt to subvert
their contract, especially if they feel they have been tricked or
treated poorly, interpreting a contract in ways that will hopefully
cause the caster distress or peril.</p>
<p>Failure to fulfil a contract on the caster’s part can have terrible
consequences. A creature, its liege, or master may all attempt
to enact some measure of revenge at some time. Or, if the caster
violates his alignment or code, or fails to uphold a sworn oath,
the caster’s deity may impose some penalty or dishonor.</p>

“Do as I desire or suffer the consequences” is the essence of this
  spell. The caster places a magical command on the spell’s target,
  through means that are magical, divine and mental, to carry out
  some quest or service, or to refrain from some activity or course
  of action. If the geased individual fails to do as instructed, they
  sicken and will most likely die. A geas must be carefully worded
  by the caster, or it may lead to a quest with a goal not intended,
  or the spell may simply fail altogether. The caster of the geas may
  release the affected creature from it at any time.
  <p>Although a geas can command almost any course of activity,
it cannot compel a creature to commit suicide or perform
acts that would result in certain death. The creature affected
must be able to understand the caster’s command, or the spell
fails. A geased creature is bound with the spell until the task is
completed, no matter how long it takes, but if the instructions
involve an open-ended task that the character cannot complete
through its own actions, the spell ends after one day.</p>
<p>If a creature ignores the geas, or is prevented from obeying
it, they suffer consequences. A creature will lose 1 point of
strength and suffer a -1 penalty to all saving throws for every
day during which the quest is not undertaken. If they again
take up the quest, the penalties cease. If a creature ignores a
quest for 5 days in a row, they must make a constitution save or
sicken. A sickened character moves at half normal speed, suffers
a -4 penalty on constitution and dexterity, heals no damage
naturally, and cannot benefit from magical healing.</p>
<p>A sickened character must also again make a constitution
save after a number of days have passed equal to the creature’s
normal constitution score. Failure means the creature is
disabled, unable to move or act beyond a crawl. All of these
effects end 1 day after the character deliberately attempts to
resume the quest.</p>
<p>A geas and its effects can be removed magically by remove curse
(but only if the caster of the remove curse is at least two levels
higher than the level of the character who cast the geas , and the
caster of the remove curse makes a successful charisma check),
or a wish. Dispel magic does not affect a geas.</p>

  To cast a glyph of warding, the caster inscribes an area or object
  with an invisible inscription that harms those who enter,
  pass, open the warded area or object, or otherwise break the
  conditions of the ward set by the caster. It can encompass an
  area up to 25 feet x 25 feet. An ounce of oil (1sp) mixed with
  incense (5sp) and a powdered gemstone of color appropriate to
  the caster’s deity (200gp) is needed to activate the spell. Glyphs
  can be set to permit or ward against a specific individual or
  individuals, or even entire species or groups of species. They can
  be set to admit only characters of certain faiths or alignments,
  or carrying certain items, wearing certain garments, colors, or
  signs or uttering certain passwords. Any creature violating the
  warded area is subject to its magic.

  <p>Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally, but can be
fooled by polymorph and non detection spells, and they are not
triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple
glyphs cannot be cast on the same area or object, although more
than one glyphed object may be placed in close proximity. A
glyph can be made to conform to any shape, up to the limitations
of the spell’s area.</p>

<p>Read magic permits a character to see a glyph, and a successful
intelligence check allows the same character to identify the
glyph. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows
the character to know the basic nature of the glyph. Glyphs are
affected by dispel magic. Depending on the version selected, a
glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell:</p>

<p> <b>Blast Glyph:</b> This glyph causes 1d4 damage per caster
level to the intruder and all within 5 feet of the intruder. A
successful Wis save reduces damage by one-half. Damage
may be either from acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, as
determined by caster. Because the damage is entirely divine,
however, the type of damaging agent has no secondary effect.</p>
<p> <b>Spell Glyph:</b> Stores any single spell of up to 3rd level that
the caster knows. The spell must be cast as part of the process
of inscribing the glyph. When it is violated, the spell operates
as if the caster cast it at that time, allowing normal saves as
per the spell.</p>

  This spell cures the draining touch of the undead as well as
  many other deleterious effects. Greater restoration dispels all
  effects reducing or penalizing a character’s abilities, cures all
  temporary and permanently drained attribute scores, and
  also removes all forms of insanity, confusion, feeblemind or
  similar mental effects. Even more potently, it restores all levels
  previously drained (and all class benefits such as hit points and
  abilities) by undead.

  Drained levels can only be restored if this spell is cast no more
  than 1 week per caster level after the drain.

  The caster shapes quasi-real illusions, resembling monsters, that
  can attack the caster’s foes. The shadow conjurations remain
  semi-solid, even to those who disbelieve them. The caster can
  create one or more illusions whose total HD are equal to the
  caster’s level. The caster chooses what form the illusions take,
  be they goblin, orc or lion, but size is restricted to medium or
  small. The shadow creatures have only 40% of the normal or
  maximum hit points of a creature of the chosen type.

  Characters interacting with these illusions believe them to be
real creatures, unless they make a successful intelligence save.
If the saving throw fails, the creatures deal normal damage and
have all the normal abilities and weaknesses of a creature of
that type. If the saving throw succeeds, the creatures’ special
abilities, armor class, damage and all other aspects will be only
40% as strong as the real thing. Those who succeed at their
saves see the conjurations as transparent images superimposed
on vague, shadowy forms.

  This mighty spell is a useful tool in the defense of towers,
  strongholds, and other dwellings. The caster must be somewhere
  within the area being warded to cast the spell. The spell radiates
  out and away from the caster in a 20 foot/level diameter sphere,
  creating the effects detailed below within the building. The whole
  warded area radiates magic with incredible intensity. A dispel magic
  cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A
  successful disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards spell.
  <p>1. Any creature facing a choice in direction, such as a corridor
  intersection or side passage, becomes subject to a minor
  confusion-type effect, making it 50% likely that they will
  believe they are going in the exact opposite direction from
  the one they actually chose. SR: Yes.</p>
<p> 2. All corridors within the area of the spell fill with an eerie
  fog, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5
  feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment;
  creatures farther away have full concealment. SR: No.</p>
<p> 3. All doors are subjected to the lock spell (see knock). SR:
No.</p>
<p>4. One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear
as if it were a plain wall, and may only be detected with a
successful intelligence (disbelief) save. SR: No.</p>
<p>5. Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom, the strands identical
to those of the web spell, except that they regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards
and wards spell is in effect. SR: No.</p>
<p>6. The caster may also select one of the following:
a. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. SR: No.
b. A magic mouth in two places. SR: No.
c. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear and
linger in the places the caster designates; they return
within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards
and wards spell lasts. SR: Yes.</p>

<p>d. A suggestion in one place. The caster selects a 10
square foot area (or less), and any creature who enters
or passes through the area receives the suggestion
mentally. SR: Yes.</p>
<p>e. Dancing lights in four corridors. The character can
designate a simple routine that the lights will repeat
for as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. SR: No.</p>

  This spell sanctifies a large 150 foot radius area of a holy site.
  The spell has four effects.

  <p>First, the entire area operates as a magic circle against evil
  (or good, chaos or law, as chosen by the caster). All warded
  creatures in the area receive a +2 bonus to armor class and
  saves against attacks by creatures of the selected alignment.
  Likewise, the spell blocks any attempt to possess or mentally
  control a warded creature, and prevents bodily contact by
  summoned or conjured creatures. The protection against
  contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if a warded
  individual makes an attack against such a creature. Spell
  resistance can allow a summoned creature to overcome this
  protection and touch the warded creature. These effects are
  not cumulative with protection from evil.</p>

  <p>Second, all attempts to turn undead gain a +3 bonus. Attempts
to command undead suffer a -3 penalty.</p>

<p>Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be
turned into an undead creature.</p>

<p>Fourth, the character may choose to affix a single spell effect
to the hallowed site. The character must cast the spell when
casting hallow. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions
throughout the entire consecrated site, regardless of its
normal duration and area of effect. The caster may designate
whether the effects apply to all creatures, or only to creatures
who share the character’s faith or alignment. At the end of
the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or
replaced simply by casting hallow again. Spell effects that may
be tied to a hallowed site include aid, bless, cause fear, detect evil
(good, chaos, law), detect magic, dispel magic, endure elements,
freedom of movement, protection from elements, remove fear, resist
elements, silence and tongues.</p>

<p>The reverse of this spell, unhallow, provides the above effects, but
against good creatures. Any dead body buried in an unhallowed
area, however, will rise as a zombie in 24 hours.</p>

  Haste is a powerful but dangerous magic that is usually cast
  in times of great desperation. Haste affects one creature and
  doubles the affected creature’s movement rate and number of
  attacks per round. Neither spell casting nor other actions are
accelerated. A creature affected by haste ages one year, and
assumes the risk of permanent bodily damage from the strain of
the spell. At the end of the spell’s duration, an affected creature
must make a successful constitution saving throw or lose 1 hit
point permanently.

<p>Slow is the reverse of haste. It reduces by ½ a creature’s
movement and number of attacks per round. A creature affected
by slow suffers no aging or other bodily strain. Haste dispels and
counters slow, and vice-versa.</p>

  This powerful curative enables the caster to wipe away
  disease and injury. It completely cures all hit point damage,
  all diseases, blindness, deafness and all temporary ability
  damage. It neutralizes poisons in the subject’s system, so that
  no additional damage or effects are suffered. It nullifies a
  feeblemind spell. It cures mental disorders caused by nature,
  spell, or injury to the brain. Heal does not remove negative
  levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore
  permanently drained ability scores. The reverse of the spell,
  harm, drains the target of all but 4 hit points and causes
  disease in the subject (see remove disease).
  <p>A heal spell cast upon an undead creature affects it as if the
harm spell were cast upon it. A harm spell cast upon an undead
creature affects it as if a heal spell were cast.</p>
<p>The illusionist version of the spell acts in the same manner with
two important exceptions. The spell recipient of the spell must
make an intelligence saving throw. If the creature fails the saving
throw, the spell acts normally. If the creature makes the saving

  This spell raises the temperature of metal items, such as
  weapons and armor, while its reverse, chill metal, lowers the
  temperature. Magical metal items are not affected. The spell
  affects the equipment of one creature per two caster levels and
  the creatures can be no more than 25 feet apart. If the metal
  targeted is not held or worn, the the amount affected is 25
  pounds per level.
  <p>This spell lasts for 7 rounds. On the first and seventh round of
the spell, the metal becomes warm or chilly, and uncomfortable
to touch but deals no damage. During the second and sixth
rounds, burning heat or icy coldness causes pain and 1d4
damage. In the third, fourth and fifth rounds, the metal is
searing hot or freezing cold, causing disabling pain and 2d4
damage per round. The disabling pain results in the hands and/
or body becoming totally disabled for 1-4 days.</p>

<p>Any heat or cold intense enough to damage the creature negates
heat or cold damage from this spell (and vice versa) on a pointfor-
point basis. Underwater, heat metal deals half damage and
boils the surrounding water, and chill metal deals no damage,
but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it
more buoyant.</p>

  A powerful cleric uttering a holy word (good) or unholy word

  <p>The caster gestures and utters a droning incantation which

  The caster can use this rapt attention to make suggestions
  and requests seem quite plausible. The spell affects 2d4 HD of
  creatures in a 25 foot x 25 foot area. Creatures with fewer HD are
  affected first. Only creatures that can see or hear the character
  are affected. Hypnosis can succeed regardless of whether or not
  the target creatures can comprehend the caster’s speech.</p>
  <p>Hypnotized creatures cannot move or act, though they can
  be “snapped out of it” if attacked or disturbed in any way.
  Hypnotized creatures will not remember being entranced.
  Hypnotism will not succeed in the thick of combat or other
  dangerous situations.</p>
<p>  While the subject is hypnotized, the caster can make a suggestion
  or request. The suggestion must be brief and reasonable. Each
  suggestion takes one round to communicate. If the suggestion
  is reasonable, it can influence the subject’s actions, according
  to the discretion of the Castle Keeper. The Castle Keeper
  may allow additional intelligence saves for the subject if the
  suggestion is less than reasonable. Even once the spell ends, an
  affected creature retains its new attitude toward the caster, but
  only with respect to a particular suggestion.</p>

  This spell requires a successful touch attack to affect the target,
  who is then entombed, in a state of suspended animation in
  a small sphere, far beneath the surface of the earth. For the
  victim, time ceases to flow. The creature does not grow older,
  its body functions virtually cease, it does not need food or
  water and no force or effect can harm it. Most divinations will
  not reveal the creature but discern location does. The subject
  remains entombed unless the reverse of this spell, freedom, is
  cast where the imprisonment took place. A wish spell will
  not free a creature but will reveal where it is entombed. The

  A horde of insects swarm forth from the spell’s point of origin, in a
  thick cloud 180 feet in diameter. The insects limit vision to 10 feet,
  and spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures inside
  the insect plague, regardless of AC, sustain 1 point of damage at
  the end of each round they remain within it. All creatures with
  2 or fewer HD are driven from the cloud at their fastest possible
  speed in a random direction, and flee until they are at least 100
  feet away from the insects. Creatures with 3 to 5 HD flee as well,
  unless they succeed at a charisma saving throw.
  <p>The horde of insects does not move from the targeted area of

torch is ineffective against the horde. Lightning, cold, and ice
are ineffective, but a strong wind (21+ mph), that covers the

  This spell allows the caster to summon one pre-prepared item
  from virtually any location directly to the caster’s hand. Unless
  it is the caster’s personal staff, the item cannot weigh more than
  10 pounds and cannot be over 6 feet in length, width, or depth.
  The caster places a personal mark on the item, and casts the
  spell on a gem worth at least 2,500 gp, which magically and
  invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the gem. Thereafter,
  the character can summon the item by speaking a special word
  set by the character when the spell is cast, and crushing the
  gem. The item appears instantly in the caster’s hand. Only the
  original caster can use the gem in this way. If the item is in
  the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but
  the caster immediately knows who the possessor is, and roughly
  where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. The
  item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other
  creature has claimed ownership of it.

  This spell opens stuck or locked doors, even magically held
  ones. It slides bolts and lifts latches. It opens secret doors,
  as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests, and also
  loosens shackles or chains that have been employed to hold
  closures shut. Non-magical items opened by a knock spell
  do not lock by themselves once opened. Knock can not
  raise portcullises or similar impediments, nor can it undo
  or untangle knots. Each spell can undo up to two means
  of preventing egress through a portal. If used to open a
  magically locked closure, knock does not remove the spell
  but simply inhibits its functioning for 10 minutes.
  <p>Lock is the reverse of knock. It magically locks a single portal,
chest or box, preventing it from being opened by any mundane
means short of breaking or bypassing the portal itself; any
magical means of opening, such as dispel magic or knock work
normally. The caster can freely pass the character’s own lock
without affecting it.</p>

  bringing to light knowledge about a legendary person, place or
  thing. If the person or thing is close at hand, or if the caster
  is in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 x 10
  minutes. If the caster only possesses detailed information on
  the person, place or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and
  the resulting knowledge gleaned is less complete and specific.
  If the caster knows little beyond rumor, the casting time is 2d6
  weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete. However
  it may enable the caster to locate more detailed information.
  While casting this spell, the caster cannot engage in anything
  other than routine activities such as sleeping and eating. When
  completed, the spell brings the legends, if any exist, about the
  individual, location or thing to the caster’s mind.
  <p>The tales reveal themselves as long-forgotten and sometimes
cryptic memories, riddles or rhymes, regardless of whether the
legends are current, long forgotten or obscure. Subjects lacking
legendary importance provide no information whatsoever. As a
rule of thumb, characters of 10th level and higher are legendary,
as are the sorts of creatures they strive against, the major
magical items they wield, and the places where they performed
their great or nefarious deeds.</p>

  The caster unleashes a blinding, sizzling arc of forking electricity
  that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level. The caster
  channels the electricity through a small iron rod (1sp) that has
  been left out in a thunderstorm. The bolt is 10 feet wide x 50
  feet long or 5 feet wide x 100 feet long. The bolt erupts from
  the caster’s fingertips, staff, rod or wand. It strikes creatures
  and objects along its sinuous path and even a couple of feet
  to either side, igniting combustibles, sundering wooden doors
  and melting metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold,
  copper, silver or bronze.

rebounds again.</p>

  Though the scope of the wish granted by this potent spell may
  be limited, much can be accomplished by the imaginative caster
  within its strict bounds. This spell may duplicate the effects of
  any wizard spell of 6th level or lower, any illusionist spell of 5th
  level or lower or any cleric or druid spell of 4th level or lower. It
  may also grant other effects in line with the power of such spells,
  although any effects must be approved by the Castle Keeper.
  The caster must be cautious in phrasing the spell though, for
  the desires of the greedy often end in disaster, and the spell
  is very literal in its fulfilment of the caster’s wish. Duplicated
  spells allow saving throws and spell resistance as normal.

  With this spell, the caster need never fear misplacing his tower
  key again, for it enables the caster to sense the direction of a wellknown
  or clearly visualized object, including apparel, jewelry,
  furniture, tools, weapons or even such mundane implements as
  a ladder. All the caster needs is a small 2gp glass lens or opaque
  crystal. The spell may be used to search for general items such
  as a stairway, a sword or a jewel, in which case the spell locates
  the nearest such object within its range, or the spell may be used
  to find a specific item, such as a particular piece of jewelry. A
  unique object (such as Gideon Thorne’s gold-plated quill) may not
  be located unless the caster has observed that particular item
  first-hand. The spell is blocked by lead, fooled by polymorphing,
  and cannot detect creatures.

<p>Obscure object, the reverse of this spell, may be cast on an object,
thereby preventing it from being located by spells of this type, or
by divinatory means such as scrying, for the duration of the spell.</p>

  This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject, to a
  distance of 10 feet, that offers protection against one axis of
  alignment (evil, good, chaos, or law) which is decided at the
time of casting. Only one such protective spell can be in effect
in one place at the same time, even if each protects against a
different alignment.

<p>The barrier moves with the subject and grants a +2 bonus to
armor class and saving throws against creatures of the chosen
alignment. The spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or
conjured creatures of any alignment: the melee attacks of such
creatures fail and the creatures recoil from the protective magic.
The protection against contact by summoned or conjured
creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against,
or tries to force the barrier against, the blocked creature. Spell
resistance can allow a summoned or conjured creature to
overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>

<p>The magical circle also blocks any attempt to possess or
exercise mental control over the warded creature by foes of
any alignment. The protection does not prevent casting a spell
that gains mental control, but it prevents the caster of such
a spell from mentally commanding the protected creature. If
the protection ends before the mental control does, the enemy
caster would then be able to exercise such mental control of the
creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force
but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.</p>


<p>This spell has a special function that the character may choose
when casting the spell. A magic circle can be focused inward
rather than outward. In this case, it serves as an immobile,
temporary magical prison for a summoned creature. The
creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. The caster must
beat a creature’s SR in order to keep it at bay, but the bonuses
and the protection from mental control apply regardless of an
enemy’s SR. If a creature is too large to fit into the spell’s area,
the spell succeeds but for that creature only.</p>

  By casting magic jar, the caster places their own soul into a
  gem or large crystal, which must be of at least 1000gp in value,
  leaving the caster’s own body lifeless. The caster may then
  attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing the target’s
  soul into the magic jar.
  <p>While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life
force on the same plane within 10 feet per caster level. The
caster, however, cannot determine the exact creature types or
positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, the caster
can sense a difference of four or more HD and can determine
whether a life force is positive or negative energy. Attempting
to possess a body is an attack, and it is blocked by protection from
evil or a similar ward.</p>

<p>The caster possesses the body and forces the creature’s soul into
the magic jar unless the subject succeeds at a charisma save.
Failure to take over the host leaves the caster’s life force in
the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds at further
saving throws if the caster attempts to possess its body again.</p>


<p>If successful, the caster’s life force occupies the host body, and
the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster
keeps his or her intelligence, wisdom, charisma, level, class,
base attack bonus, prime attributes, alignment, and mental
abilities while the host body retains its strength, dexterity,
constitution, hit points, natural abilities and extraordinary
abilities such as water breathing or regeneration. A body with
extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks
(or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
The caster can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary
or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like
abilities do not stay with the body.</p>

<p>The caster may move back to the jar, returning the trapped soul
to its body, at any time; and may thereafter attempt to possess
another body. The spell ends when the caster chooses to return
to the caster’s own body (leaving the receptacle empty).</p>

<p>To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range. When
the caster’s soul transfers to the jar, the caster’s original body is,
as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p>

<p>If the host body is slain the caster returns to the magic jar, if
within range, and the life force of the host dies. If the host body
is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the caster and the
host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p>
<p>At the end of the spell, the caster’s soul returns to the caster’s
body, regardless of whether the soul is in the magic jar or a
host body. Should a host’s soul be in the magic jar at the end
of the spell, the soul returns to the host’s body. However,
if the caster’s soul or the host’s soul is too far distant from
its body, then the caster or host, possibly both, will die.
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell. A magic jar may
also be dispelled by casting a dispel magic (or greater) spell on
either the receptacle or the host.</p>

  This spell creates the illusion of an object, creature, or force,
  as visualized by the caster. Sound, smell, and thermal illusions
  are all within the spells power to create. Creatures who view
  the illusion believe it, and can suffer damage from illusions.
  Hit point damage is suffered from damage to the mind/psyche.
  While concentrating, the caster can move the image within the
  range. The image persists for 3 rounds after the caster ceases
  concentrating. The image disappears if an opponent makes the
  saving throw. The spell affects a 40 cubic foot area + 10 cubic
  feet per level.

  This charm affects from one to a number of creatures whose
  combined HD do not exceed twice the caster’s level, and are
  located in a 50 square foot area. If there are more potential
  targets than the caster can affect, the caster chooses them one
  at a time until reaching a creature whose HD bring the total
  above the spell’s maximum.

  The targets regard the caster as a trusted friend and ally. If the
  creatures are currently being threatened or attacked by the
  caster or the caster’s allies, they receive a +5 bonus on their
  saving throw. The spell does not enable the caster to control the
  charmed creatures like automatons, but the subjects perceive
  the caster’s words and actions in the most favorable way. The
  caster can try to give a subject orders, but must succeed at a
  charisma check to convince the subject to do anything it
  wouldn’t ordinarily do. Any act by the caster or the caster’s
  apparent allies that threatens the charmed creature breaks
  the spell. Note also that the caster must speak the creature’s

  This powerful curative enables the caster to wipe away

  foot area. It completely cures all hit point damage, all
  diseases, blindness, deafness and all temporary ability
  damage. It neutralizes poisons in a subject’s system, so that

  feeblemind spell. It cures mental disorders caused by nature,
  spell or injury to the brain. Mass heal does not restore

  The group of creatures targeted vanish from sight, even from
  darkvision, deepvision, and twilight vision. If the recipients are
  carrying gear, the gear vanishes too. Individuals in the group
  cannot see each other, unless they can normally see invisible
  things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by
  an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if
  tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light,
  however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can
  (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any
  part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more
  than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
  <p>The subjects are not magically silenced, and certain other
conditions can render the recipients detectable (such as stepping
in a puddle). The spell ends if anyone in the group attacks any
creature, including casting a spell targeting a foe or whose area
or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unintended objects
do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.
If the subject attacks directly it becomes visible immediately
along with all its gear. Note that spells specifically affecting
allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when
they include foes in their area.</p>
<p>The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than
180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two
individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other
one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each
other, they both become visible when the distance between
them exceeds 180 feet.)</p>

  The spell is the same as suggestion except that this spell can
  affect more creatures. The caster influences the actions of
  the creatures by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a
  sentence or two). The number of creatures affected is equal to
  one per level of the caster and all must be within a 25 foot area.
  The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make
  the activity sound reasonable. The victim must understand the
  language of the caster making the suggestion. Any attempt to
  suggest an act that would be harmful to the victim or something
  severely at odds with their behavior will allow the affected
  creature to automatically break the enchantment. The Castle
  Keeper is free to factor in penalties to the victim’s saving throw
  for quite reasonable suggestions as well as give the target
  bonuses to their saves for unreasonable or harmful suggestions.

  <p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire
duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked
to do. The caster can instead specify conditions that will triggers
a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met
before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.</p>

  The caster may choose either four large 2-foot diameter or eight

  <p>The four large spheres explode with their points of origin forming

not hidden or changed in appearance, although they can hide
within the illusion as if it were real.
<p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile and olfactory
elements. The illusion persists until dispelled or disbelieved
by an intelligent creature and requires an appropriate piece of
terrain to mimic.</p>
