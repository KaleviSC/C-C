<h4>NAME</h4>
this is the name by which the spell is generally known.
A spell that is reversible is indicated with an asterisk (*) symbol
next to the name. Some spells have more than one variation,
which are sometimes indicated in the name of the spell.
    <h4>CASTER AND SPELL LEVEL</h4>
    specifies each class that can
cast the spell and the spell level.
    <h4>    CASTING TIME (CT): </h4>
    the time required to cast a spell,
    expressed in rounds (from 1 to 5). Complex spells may take more
    time to cast, and such casting times are expressed in rounds (rd),
    minutes (min), hours (hr) or days. For relative understanding of
    casting time, a round is 10 seconds.
<h4>    RANGE </h4>
the maximum distance from the character at
which the spell can affect a target, expressed in feet.

<h4>DURATION (D): </h4>
how long the spell lasts, expressed in rounds
(rd), hours (hr), days, weeks (wks), months (mth), or years (yr).
For relative understanding of time, a round is 10 seconds.

  <h4>SAVING THROW (SV)</h4>

  most harmful spells allow an
  affected creature to make a saving throw to avoid some or
  all of the effect. This entry details whether a spell allows a
  saving throw, what type of saving throw is made, and the
  effect of a successful save. A parenthetical (h) indicates a
  harmless spell, one that is usually beneficial but still allows a
  targeted creature to attempt a saving throw if it wishes. If a
  spell does not include a saving throw entry, then assume no
  saving throw is allowed.

  <h4>SPELL RESISTANCE (SR)</h4>
  Whether spell resistance (SR)
  will resist the spell. A parenthetical (h) indicates a harmless
  spell, one that is usually beneficial but still allows a targeted
  creature to attempt to resist the spell if it wishes. If a spell
  does not include a spell resistance entry, then assume no spell
  resistance check is allowed.


  <h4>COMPONENTS</h4>
  This entry indicates what the
  character must have or do to cast the spell. If the necessary
  components are not present, the casting fails. Spells can
  have verbal (V), somatic (S), material (M), focus (F), divine
  focus (DF) components, any combination thereof, or even
  other special components. If the material component, focus
  or define focus has a gp cost, the cost is listed; otherwise the
  character can assume that the actual materials involved are at
  the discretion of the caster and have no significant monetary
  value. Material components are always consumed during the
  casting of a spell; a focus or divine focus is not. If a special
  focus or divine focus is required, it will be unique to the spell
  and cannot be used as the focus for other spells.

            This spell allows a single target creature to tread on air or
liquid as if walking on solid ground. The caster must choose the
version of the spell desired upon the initial casting of the spell.
<p>Air Walk: The maximum upward or downward angle possible
is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the creature’s normal
movement. A strong wind (21+ mph) can push an air walker
along or hold the walker back. Each round at the end of the
walker’s turn, the wind blows the walker 5 feet for each 5 miles
per hour of wind speed.</p>
<p>Water Walk: The creature’s feet hover an inch above the
surface. Any liquid may be traversed, including mud,
oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava
(although creatures crossing molten lava or other harmful
surfaces still take damage from the heat or other harm). The
creature can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across
the surface as if it were normal ground. If the spell is cast
underwater (or while the subject is partially submerged),
the subject is borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round
until they can stand on it.</p>

The caster summons a small animal to watch over an area.
Each time a creature enters the warded area, a mental or
audible alarm is triggered. Whether the alarm is mental or
audible is left up to the caster but must be decided upon at the
moment the spell is cast. A creature who speaks the password,
also determined at the time of casting, does not set off the
alarm. The caster may elect to have small animals not set off
the alarm. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm
unless the intruder becomes material while in the warded area.
The spell’s area of affect is a 50 ft. diameter circle and requires
a small bell to activate.
<p>Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts the caster so long as
the character remains within a mile of the warded area. It
will also awaken the caster from normal sleep, but does not
otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect
on a mental alarm.</p>
<p>Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a
bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it
clearly. Doors and walls will reduce the distance by 10 to 20 feet.
In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly up to 180
feet. The ringing lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence
spell cannot hear the ringing.</p>

  This spell allows the caster to enlarge or reduce a creature
  or object, increasing or decreasing both size and weight. The
  subject may be altered by up to 10% per caster level, increasing
  by this amount in height, width and depth (to a maximum of
  50%). Alter size affects one creature or one object of up to 10
  cubic ft/lvl in volume.
  <p>Weight increases by approximately the cube of the size increase,
as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>HEIGHT INCREASE</th>
    <th>WEIGHT INCREASE</th>

    <td>+10% (X 1.1)</td>

<p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is also changed by
the spell. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth
or reduction, the creature or object attains the maximum
possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process. However,
it is constrained without harm by stronger materials: the spell
cannot be used to crush a creature by its own growth.</p>
<p>Magical properties are not increased by this spell. Weight, mass,
and strength are affected though. A creature’s hit points, armor
class, and to hit bonus do not change, but strength increases
along with size. For every 20% of enlargement, the creature
gains a +1 bonus to strength.</p>

By means of this spell, the caster befriends and wins the loyalty
  of an animal. The spell functions only if the caster actually
  wishes to become the animal’s friend, and uses food to initiate
  the spell. Otherwise the spell fails. The befriended animal’s
  loyalty is natural (not magical) and lasting. The caster can teach
  the befriended animal 3-6 specific tricks or tasks. The tricks or
  tasks cannot be complex, generally mimicking those taught to
  a pet or mount. It takes at least a week for an animal to learn
  each trick.
  <p>  The animal is still an animal. While it may have learned some
    tricks, it is still no more intelligent than any other animal of its kind,
    and it retains all its bestial instincts. Unlike intelligent followers or
    cohorts, animals can’t follow complex instructions. Animals are
    ill-equipped to handle unusual situations, such as combats with
    invisible opponents, and they typically hesitate to attack weird and
    unnatural creatures. Left to its own judgment, an animal follows a
    caster and attacks creatures that attack the caster or that attack
    the animal itself. To do more than that, it needs to learn tricks.
    Some typical tricks or tasks include the following:</p>
<p><b>Attack:</b> The animal attacks apparent enemies. The
  character may point to a particular creature and direct the
  animal to attack that creature. Normally, an animal will not
  attack unnatural creatures (though it will defend people,
  guard places and protect characters against them). Teaching
  an animal to attack unnatural creatures counts as two tricks.</p>
<p><b>Come:</b> The animal comes to the character, even if the animal
normally would not do so such as following the character
onto a boat.</p>
<p><b>Defend:</b> The animal defends the character or is ready to
defend the character if no threat is present.</p>
<p><b>Down:</b> The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise
backs down.</p>
<p><b>Fetch:</b> The animal goes and gets something. The character
must point out a specific object or the animal fetches some
random object.</p>
<p><b>Guard:</b> The animal stays in place and prevents others from
approaching.</p>
<p> <b>Heel:</b> The animal follows the character closely, even to
places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
<p><b>Perform:</b> The animal does a variety of simple tricks like
sitting up, rolling over, roaring and so on. Each of these must
be taught separately.</p>
<p><b>Protect:</b> The animal follows a specific character and protects
them.</p>
<p><b>Seek:</b> The animal moves into an area and looks around for
anything unusual.</p>
<p><b>Stay:</b> The animal stays in place waiting for the character to
return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by,
though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
<p><b>Track:</b> The animal tracks the scent presented to it.
</p>
<p>A caster can have more than one animal friend, but their hit
dice can total no more than twice the caster’s level. A caster
may dismiss animal friends to befriend new ones.</p>
<p>If the caster spends most of her time in the animals’ home
territory and treats them well, the caster can approach and
maintain the maximum hit dice allowed. If the caster spends
most of the time at sea, in cities or otherwise in places that
the animals don’t like, the animals desert or will return to their
native lands, and the caster will not be able to retain even half
the maximum hit dice. Remember, these creatures are loyal
friends but are not pets or servants. They won’t remain loyal if
being the caster’s friend becomes too onerous.</p>

  The caster causes up to a maximum of eight animals to grow to
twice their normal size. This doubles each animal’s height, length,
and width, increasing its weight by a factor of eight. The increase in
size has a number of effects. The animal’s HD doubles, increasing
the animal’s bonus to hit and saving throws accordingly. The
increase in size increase the damage the animal delivers by onethird.
It also doubles the animal’s constitution bonus. When the
spell ends, the animal’s HP return to normal, and all damage taken
while enlarged is divided by 2. The spell gives the character no
special means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.
Thus, the spell is often combined with speak with animals and a
charm spell. Animal growth has a 25 x 25 foot area of effect.

  Using food to initiate the spell the caster compels a small
  animal to go to a spot the caster designates. The spell has no
  effect on an animal tamed, trained or under the influence of
  someone else. The caster can mentally impress on the animal a
  certain place well known to the caster or an obvious landmark.
  The directions must be simple, as the animal depends on the
  caster’s knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own.
  The caster can attach a small item or note to the messenger.
  The animal travels to the location and waits there until the
  spell expires. During the period of waiting, the animal allows
  others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries.
  The intended recipient of a message gains no special ability to
  communicate with the animal or read any attached message.

The caster polymorphs up to one willing creature per level,
  in a 25 x 25 foot area, into a small or medium animal of the
  caster’s choice. Recipients remain in the animal form until the
  spell expires or the caster dismisses the spell. The caster can
  designate the new form’s physical qualities (such as hair color,
  hair texture, skin color, height, weight and gender), but all must
  fall within the norms for the species.
<p>Upon changing into an animal, a subject regains lost hit points
  as if having rested for a day (though this healing does not
  restore temporary ability damage or provide other benefits of
  resting for a day). Further, the polymorphed subject acquires the
  physical and natural abilities of the animal while retaining its
  own mind. In general, the subject’s new scores and faculties are
  average ones for the species into which it has been transformed.
  Natural abilities include armor class (if better), attack routines
  and damage, movement capabilities such as walking, swimming
  and flight, and extraordinary vision. The subject does not gain
  any extraordinary abilities of the animal.</p>
<p>  The subject retains its prime attributes, intelligence, wisdom and
  charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change
  in its constitution modifier), alignment and attack bonus. The
  subject can cast spells for which it has components. When the
  polymorph occurs, however, the subject’s equipment, if any,
  melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional; material
  components and focuses melded in this way cannot be used to
  cast spells. A humanlike voice is required for verbal components,
  and humanlike hands are require for somatic components.</p>

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures in a 25
  x 25 feet area into undead skeletons or zombies that follow
  the caster’s spoken commands. The undead can follow the
  caster, or can remain in an area and attack any creature or
  specific type of creature entering the area. The undead remain
  animated until they are destroyed. Destroyed undead can’t be
  animated again. Regardless of the type of undead, the caster
  can’t create more HD of undead than the caster has levels in
  any single casting of the spell.
  <p>  The undead remain under the caster’s control indefinitely. No
    matter how many times the caster uses this spell, however, the
    character can only control 2 HD worth of undead creatures
    per caster level. If the caster exceeds this number, all the newly
    created creatures fall under the caster’s control, and any excess
    undead from previous castings become uncontrolled (the
    character chooses which creatures are released). If the caster is
    a cleric, any undead the character might command by virtue of
    the caster’s power to command or rebuke undead, do not count
    toward the spell’s limits.</p>
<p>  A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or
  skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made
  from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones. A zombie, however,
  can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The statistics
  for skeletons and zombies are detailed in Monsters & Treasure;
  undead created with this spell do not retain any abilities the
  creature may have had while alive.</p>
  <p><i>Preserve Dead:</i> This reverse version may only be cast by divine
  spellcasters, and has two effects. First, the caster preserves the
  remains of the target corpses so that they do not decay, for one
  day per level of the caster. Doing so extends the time limit on
  raising that creature from the dead. The spell works on severed
  body parts and the like. Second, the spell permanently prevents
  the target corpses from being animated by an animate dead spell.
  If a target corpse is preserved, and then raised from the dead or
  resurrected, the spell ends.</p>

  By means of this spell or its reverse variation, the caster causes
  one location or one object to emanate magical vibrations
  that repel or attract a specific order of intelligent creature or
  creatures of a particular alignment. The creature to be affected
  must be named specifically and defined by the caster during the
  casting of the spell; larger groups, such as a type or subtype,
  are not specific enough. Alternatively, a specific alignment can
  be named. For example, the caster could specify zombies, but
  not undead; alternatively, the caster could specify neutral evil
  creatures. This spell cannot be cast upon living creatures.
  <p>If the spell is cast upon a location, the area affected is a 10 foot
  square area per level of the caster. If the spell is cast upon an
  object, only the object is affected. Casting the spell requires at
  least 1,500 gp worth of gems or jewelry.</p>
  <p> <i>Antipathy</i> The spell emanates eldritch vibrations that repel
  specified creatures, forcing them to abandon the area or item.
  The creatures will not willingly return while the spell is in effect.
  A creature which makes a successful saving throw can stay in the
  area or touch the item, but feels hesitant and very uncomfortable
  doing so. This discomfort, while in effect, reduces the creature’s
  charisma by 4 points. Antipathy counters and dispels sympathy.</p>
  <p> <i>Sympathy</i> The reverse of the spell causes designated creatures to
  feel elated and pleased to be in the area, or desire to touch or to
  possess the object. The compulsion is overpowering. If the save
  is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment,
  but a subsequent save must be made every hour if the creature
  remains in the area or within the presence of the item (within
  10 feet per level of the caster). If a subsequent save fails, the
  affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.
  Sympathy counters and dispels antipathy.</p>

  The caster creates an invisible magical eye that sends the caster
  visual information. The arcane eye travels at 30 feet per round,
  and sees exactly as the caster would see if the caster were there. If
  the eye examines walls or ceilings, it moves at 10 feet per round.
  Solid barriers prevent the passage of an arcane eye, although it
  can pass through a space no smaller than a small mouse hole
  (one inch in diameter). The caster must concentrate to use the
  eye. If the caster does not concentrate, the eye becomes inert
  until the caster again concentrates.

<p> The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells
or items (though the caster can use magic to improve the
caster’s own eyesight). The caster is subject to any gaze
attack the eye encounters. A successful dispel magic cast
on the caster or the eye ends the spell. With respect to
blindness, magical darkness and other phenomena that
affect vision, the arcane eye is considered an independent
sensory organ of the caster (including a creature). Creatures

making an intelligence check. Spells such as detect scrying
can also detect the eye.</p>

  This spell frees the spirit from the body, allowing the caster to
  project an astral body into another plane. The caster can bring
  the astral forms of other creatures as well, provided the creatures
  are linked in a circle with the caster at the time of the casting.
  These fellow travelers must accompany the caster at all times
  to remain in an astral state. If something happens to the caster
  during the journey, the companions are stranded wherever the
  caster left them. The caster can bring one additional creature
  for every two levels of experience.
<p>The bodies of the caster and companions are left behind, in a
state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy
of them and all they wear or carry onto the astral plane. Because
the astral plane touches upon other planes, the caster can travel
astrally to any of these other planes as the caster wishes. The
caster then leaves the astral plane, forming a new physical
body (and equipment) on the plane of existence the caster has
chosen to enter.</p>
<p>When on the astral plane or another plane, the caster’s astral
body is connected at all times to the caster’s material body by
a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the caster is killed both
astrally and materially. Very few things can destroy a silver
cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the
incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new
body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord
simply returns to the caster’s original body, reviving it from its
state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are
able to function on the astral plane, their actions affect only
creatures existing on the astral plane.</p>
<p>The caster and the caster’s companions may travel through the
astral plane indefinitely. The spell lasts until the caster desires to
end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as
dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form,
or the destruction of the caster’s body (which kills the caster).</p>

  This spell removes the burden of evil acts or misdeeds from
  the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly
  repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. The spell
  removes the burden from a creature who committed the evil
  act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion. A suitable
  focus worth at least 500 gp and ceremonial components totaling
  100gp in cost are needed to cast the spell.
  <p>It may also be used to atone a creature who committed deliberate
misdeeds and acts of a knowing and wilful nature. In such cases,
the caster’s deity becomes directly involved in the atonement.
Such intercession has a debilitating effect on the caster. Upon
completion of the spell, the caster loses all spell casting ability for
one week and must rest for one day before resuming normal, daily
activity. Many casters first assign the atoning subject a quest or
similar penance before casting the atonement spell on their behalf.</p>

<p>Atonement may be cast for one of several purposes:</p>
<p> <b>Reverse Magical Alignment Change:</b>If a creature has
had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its
alignment to its original status.</p>
<p> <b>Restore Class or Abilities:</b>
A paladin who has lost paladin
class features due to unwillingly or unwittingly committing
an evil act may have paladinhood restored by this spell. A
paladin who willingly and deliberately commits an evil act
will not be restored. A cleric or druid who has lost the ability
to cast spells because the caster incurred the anger of their
deity may regain spell powers by seeking atonement from
another cleric of the same deity, or in the case of a druid,
another druid.</p>

<p> <b>Redemption or Temptation</b>
  The caster may cast this spell
  upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it
  a chance to change its alignment to match the caster’s. The
  subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon
  the spell’s completion, the subject freely chooses whether
  it retains its original alignment or changes to the caster’s
  alignment. No duress, compulsion or magical influence can
  force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered
if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the
spell does not work on outsiders (or any creature incapable of
changing its alignment naturally).

  By using a suitable focus worth at least 25gp an augury can tell
  the caster whether a particular action will bring good or bad
  results for the caster in the immediate future. The base chance
  for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level;
  the Castle Keeper makes the roll secretly. The Castle Keeper
  may determine that the question is so straightforward that a
  successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance
  of success. If the augury succeeds, the caster gets one of four
  results: (1) Weal (if the action will probably bring good results),
  (2) Woe (for bad results), (3) Weal and woe (for both), or (4)
  Nothing (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad
  results). If the spell fails, the caster gets the nothing result. A
  cleric who gets the nothing result has no way to tell whether it
  resulted from a failed or successful augury.
<p>The augury can see into the future only about half an hour,
so anything that might happen after that does not affect the
augury. Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the
contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person upon
the same topic use the same dice result as the first augury.</p>

  The caster awakens a tree or animal to humanlike sentience.
  To succeed, the caster must make a wisdom save, with
  the target’s hit dice constituting the challenge level. The
  awakened animal or tree is friendly toward the caster.
  The caster has no special empathy or connection with the
  awakened creature, although it serves the caster in specific
  tasks or endeavors if the caster can communicate their desires
  to it. An awakened tree has characteristics of an animated
  object. Awakened trees gain the ability to move their limbs,

  There are two versions of this spell. The caster chooses one
  when the spell is cast.

  <p><b>Barkskin armor: </b>This version grants a +3 bonus to AC due
  to the toughening of the caster’s skin. This bonus increases to
  +4 at 6th level and to +5 at 12th level and higher.</p>

  <p><b>Tree Shape:</b> This version causes the caster to assume the form
    of a small, living tree or shrub; or a large, dead tree trunk with
    a small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal
    that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed
    creature. To all normal tests the caster is, in fact, a tree or
    shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint magic upon
    the tree. While in tree form, the caster can observe all that
    transpires nearby just as if the caster were in the caster’s
    normal form, and the caster’s hit points and saves remain
    unaffected. The caster gains a +10 bonus to AC but loses
    any dexterity bonus to armor class (effective dexterity score of
    one). All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with the
    character. The caster can dismiss the tree shape at any time.</p>

  Upon casting this spell, the wizard forcibly transports a powerful
  elemental from one of the elemental planes to the plane in
  which the caster is located. The type of elemental summoned
  must be designated by the caster before the spell is begun. As
  the elemental will be a large specimen of 12 HD, fire and water
  elementals will require a large source of either element in order
  to be able to take shape. Earth and air are typically present in
  abundance. The caster can use any time which can reasonably
  be associated with the element being summoned.

  <p>The elemental does not come willingly, nor will it do the
caster’s bidding without a struggle. The caster must maintain
concentration upon the elemental to force it to serve. If the
caster moves, speaks, takes damage, or performs any other
action other than concentrating on forcing the elemental to do
his or her bidding, the elemental attacks the caster immediately,
and will not stop until destroyed. Control over the elemental
cannot be regained. It will ignore any and all opponents save
for the wizard who summoned it. The caster may release the
elemental at any time.</p>

  A binding spell creates a magical restraint, o convinces the
  recipient that such a restraint exists, to hold a creature. The
  target only gets an initial saving throw if its HD is equal to at
  least half the caster’s level. The caster may employ up to six
  assistants with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion,
  the caster’s effective caster level increases by +1. For each
  assistant who casts a charm or other appropriate spell, the
  caster’s effective level increases by +2 (provided the target
  is appropriate for the spell). All the assistants must join in
  chanting the spell as detailed below.

  <p>The binding spell has six versions. The caster chooses one when
the spell is cast. Regardless of the version cast, the caster can
specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the
creature whenever they occur. These can be as simple or elaborate
as the caster desires (subject to the Castle Keeper agreeing that
the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to
pass). The conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity
or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions
or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD or HPs do not
qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot
be changed. Setting a release condition results in a saving throw
penalty of -2, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p>A creature may only be subject to one binding spell at a time.
Additional binding spells cast on a subject already bound have
no effect.</p>

<p><b>Chaining:</b>The subject is confined by restraints that generate
an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the
subject except the caster. Duration is one year per caster
level. The subject is confined to the spot it occupied when it
became subject to the spell’s effect.</p>

<p><b>Slumber:</b> Imposes a comatose sleep upon the subject for up to
one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or
drink while slumbering, nor does it age. Saves are made at +1.</p>

<p><b>Bound Slumber:</b> A combination of chaining and slumber
that lasts for up to one month per caster level. Saves are made
at +3, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Hedged Prison:</b>The subject is transported to or otherwise
brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander
by any means. The spell is permanent. Saves are made at +4,
if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Metamorphosis: </b>The subject assumes gaseous form, except
for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other
container, which may be transparent. The creature remains
aware of its surroundings and can speak, but cannot leave
the container, attack or use any of its powers or abilities. The
binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe,
eat or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Saves are
made at +5, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

<p><b>Minimus Containment:</b>The subject is shrunk to a height
of one inch or less and held within some gem or similar object
or jar. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need
to breathe, eat or drink while contained, nor does it age.
Saves are made at +4, if the subject gets a saving throw.</p>

  This spell rapidly cycles the caster in and out of existence (into
  the ethereal plane). Blinking has several effects. Attacks against
  the caster are made at -10. If the attacker, however, is capable
  of striking ethereal or incorporeal creatures, or is able to see
  invisible creatures, then attacks are made at only -2. If the
  attacker can both see and strike ethereal creatures, the attacker
  suffers no penalty. Individually targeted spells have a 50%
  chance to fail against the character while blinking unless the
  attacker can target invisible or ethereal creatures. Area attacks,
such as dragon’s breath or fireball, cause full damage.

<p>The caster’s own attacks are made at -2. Likewise, the caster’s
own spells have a 50% chance to activate just as the character
goes ethereal, in which case they take effect on the ethereal
plane. Since the character spends about half the character’s
time on the ethereal plane, the character can see and even
attack ethereal creatures. The character interacts with ethereal
creatures roughly the same way the character interacts with
material ones.</p>

<p>While blinking, the character can step through, but not see
through, solid objects no more than 5 feet thick. If the caster
attempts to walk through material thicker than 5 feet, they
blink into the solid object, the spell ends, and they are shunted
off to the nearest open space, suffering 1d6 points of damage per
5 feet traveled through solid matter.</p>

  The caster changes a specially prepared staff into a treant-like
  creature, about 24 feet tall. The staff must be prepared over 28
  days, during which time the caster cannot adventure or engage
  in other strenuous activity. The creature looks and fights just
  like a treant, and it defends the caster and obeys any spoken
  commands. It is not a true treant; it cannot converse with actual
  treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 hit
  points or less, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.
  Otherwise, the staff can be used as the focus for another casting
  of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when
  created, despite any wounds it may have suffered the last time
  it appeared.

  A bank of yellowish-green poisonous fog billows out from the
  point the caster designates and affects a 20 foot high x 30 foot
  wide x 20 foot thick area. The fog obscures all sight, including
  extraordinary vision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet
  has one-half concealment. Creatures farther away have total
  concealment. The fog’s vapors kill any living creature with 3
  or fewer HD (no save) and causes creatures with 4 to 6 HD
  to make constitution saving throws or die. Living creatures
  above 6 HD, and creatures of 4 to 6 HD who make their saving
  throws, take 1d10 points of poison damage each round while
  in the cloud. Holding one’s breath doesn’t help unfortunately.

  <p>The cloud moves away from the caster at 10 feet per round, rolling
along the surface of the ground. Because the vapors are heavier than
air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down
openings. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four
rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in one round.</p>

of their ability unless they make a charisma saving throw. The
command must be clear and understood by the targeted creature.
A command of “die” causes the subject to fall unconscious

“suicide” would fail because it is generally used as a noun,
not as a command. A command of “awake” will counter magically

  The caster causes plants, fungi and plant creatures to do the
character’s bidding with a 50 foot diameter circle. There are
three versions of the spell described below.

<p> <b>Animate:</b> The spell imbues trees or other large, inanimate
vegetable life with mobility. The animated plants then attack
whomever or whatever the character first designates. Animated
plants gain humanlike senses. The plants’ armor class, attacks
and special abilities vary with their size and form, as described
for animated objects. The character can animate two trees, four
shrubs or eight vines. All plants to be affected must be within
50 feet of each other. The character can animate different types
of plants if desired. The effect lasts one hour per caster level.</p>

<p><b>Charm: </b>Against plant and fungus creatures, command
plants functions in the same manner as a mass charm spell.
The character can command a number of plant creatures
whose combined level or HD do not exceed three times the
character’s level. No two affected creatures can be more than
25 feet from each other, and each is allowed a charisma saving
throw. The effect lasts 1 day per caster level.</p>

<p><b>Enhanced Entangle:</b>This version acts as an enhanced
entangle spell, allowing all plants within the area of effect to
entwine about any creatures within, or moving through the
area, holding them fast. A successful dexterity save means
that the creature manages to avoided becoming entangled
for that particular round. An entangled creature suffers a -2
penalty to attack, a -4 penalty to effective dexterity, and also
cannot move, making the casting of a spells with a somatic
component impossible. Breaking free requires a successful
strength check. Each round, the plants once again attempt
to entangle all creatures who have avoided or escaped
entanglement. Spell resistance does not keep creatures from
being entangled. Plants can also free creatures trapped by an
entangle spell. The effect lasts one hour per caster level. </p>

  The caster can attempt to contact the character’s deity or
  agents and ask questions that can be answered by a simple
  yes or no answer. A cleric with no particular deity contacts a
  philosophically allied deity. This spell should be used sparingly,
  as disfavor could be gained with frequent use. The caster needs
  incense, holy symbol or other religious items.

  The caster is allowed one question per caster level. The answers
  given are correct within the limits of the deity’s knowledge. Any
  question that cannot be answered with yes or no will result in
  no answer and will count against the caster’s maximum number
  of questions. If a caster doesn’t focus on the conversation, such
  as discussing answers with others, the deity becomes angry or
  irritated, and ends the spell.

  reside there. The powers reply in a language the character

  further removed. Contact with a mind far removed from the
  caster’s home plane increases the likelihood of a successful
  answer, but likewise increases the probability that the caster
  will suffer adverse effects. On rare occasions, this form of
  divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or
  forces. The following table shows the possible consequences
  and results of the attempt.</p>

  <p> <b>Failed Saving Throw: </b>If the caster fails an intelligence
save against the indicated CL, the caster’s intelligence and
charisma scores are decreased as indicated on the table below
for one week’s duration. Lowering of intelligence can result
in the loss of bonus spells, and if reduced to 8 or less, the
loss of daily spells entirely. Additionally, the caster may go
insane when contacting a plane other than an elemental
plane. A saving throw failed by 5 or more results in insanity
in the caster. A saving throw roll of natural 1 always results in
insanity. Insanity lasts as follows:</p>

<p>Astral:1 week</p>
<p>Demigod: 1d4 weeks</p>
<p>Lesser Deity: 2d4 weeks </p>
<p>Greater Deity: 3d4 weeks</p>

<p> <b>Results of a Successful Contact:</b>The Castle Keeper rolls
D% to generate the result shown on the table:</p>
<p><b>True Answer: </b>The character gets a true, one-word answer.
Questions not capable of being answered in this way are
answered as unclear.</p>
<p><b>Don’t Know: </b>The entity tells the character that it doesn’t know.</p>
<p><b>Lie: </b>The entity intentionally lies to the character.</p>
<p><b>Random Answer: </b>The entity tries to lie but doesn’t know
the answer, so it makes one up.</p>

  This spell allows the caster to control and to converse, in

  creatures (including fungi, molds and plantlike monsters) in
  a 25 foot x 25 foot area. The caster automatically exercises
  limited control over normal plants, but plantlike creatures can

  not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but
  it does allow them to move their branches, stems and leaves.

The spell allows the caster to either raise or lower water.

<p> <b>Lower Water:</b>This use of the spell causes water (or any similar
liquid) to sink away to a minimum depth of 1 inch. The depth
can be lowered by up to 2 feet per caster level. The water
is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up
to 10 feet long per caster level. In extremely large and deep
bodies of water, a powerful caster can create a whirlpool that
sweeps ships downward, putting them at risk of damage and
rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the
duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and
other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell. The
spell has no effect on other creatures.</p>

<p> <b>Raise Water:</b>This use of the spell causes water (or any similar
liquid) to rise in height. Boats raised in this way slide down the
sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the
spell is adjacent to land, the water can spill over onto dry land.</p>

  The caster changes the weather in the local area, 2 miles x 2
  miles centered on caster. The caster can only call forth weather
  appropriate to the climate and season of the area, but can
  almost always change the direction of the wind and control its
  intensity from calm to strong. The character cannot control
  the specific applications of the weather. When the character
  selects a certain weather condition to occur, the weather
  assumes that condition 10 minutes later (changing gradually).
  The weather continues as the caster left it for the duration,
  or until the character designates a new kind of weather. Each
  change in weather by the caster takes 10 minutes to manafest.
  Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.
  Control weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena
  (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. Druids
  casting this spell double the duration and range.

  The caster alters wind force in a 100 foot diameter sphere/level,
  centered on the caster. The caster can make the wind blow
  in a certain direction or manner, and increase or decrease its
  strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the
  spell ends or the caster chooses to alter the spell, which requires
  concentration. The caster may create an “eye” of calm air up to
  50 feet in diameter at the center of the area if the character so
  desires, and the character may choose to limit the effect to any
  area less than the spell’s full area of effect.
  <p> <b>Wind Direction: </b>The caster may choose one of four basic wind
patterns to function over the spell’s area: a downdraft blows
from the center outward in equal strength in all directions;
an updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center
in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before
impinging on the eye in the center; a rotation causes the winds
to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion;
a blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across
the entire area from one side to the other.</p>
<p> <b>Wind Force: </b>For every three caster levels, the character can
increase or decrease wind force by one level of strength.
Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult. A severe
wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.
A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from
the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden
structures, tears off roofs and endangers ships. Hurricane
force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, sometimes
uproot even large trees and cause most ships to founder. A
tornado (175+ mph) destroys all non fortified buildings and
often uproots large trees.</p>

  The caster calls forth a mass of 1,000 venomous, biting and

  carpetlike mass swarms in a square 25 feet on a side. Upon the
  caster’s command, the swarm creeps forth at 10 feet per round
  toward any prey within 150 feet. Each vermin in the creeping
  doom effect automatically bites a creature for 1 point of damage
  and then dies. Each creature overrun by the swarm takes
  enough hit points of damage to kill it, destroying that number
  of vermin in the process. If there aren’t enough vermin to kill all
  the creatures in the spell’s effect, damage is distributed among
  the survivors equally. If the creeping doom travels more than
  100 feet away from the character, it loses 50 of its number for
  each additional 10 feet it travels. Anything that would deter or

  This spell causes an object or surface to radiate darkness out to
  a 20-foot radius. Not even creatures that can normally see in the
  dark can see in an area shrouded in magical darkness. Normal
  lights do not work, nor do light spells of a lower spell level.

  <p>The reverse of this spell is called daylight. Daylight causes an
  object or surface to shed light as bright as full daylight in a 60
  foot radius. Creatures that suffer penalties in bright light suffer
  them while exposed to this magical light. Darkness and daylight
  cancel each other out, leaving whatever light conditions
  normally prevail in the overlapping areas of the spells. Higherlevel
  light spells are not affected by darkness, and the reverse
  is true for daylight. If either spell is cast on a small object that
  is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell’s
  effects are blocked until the covering is removed.</p>

  This spell is an enhanced version of fireball, except the caster
  can choose to delay the detonation. With a gesture, the caster
  sends a small ball of fire hurtling through the air to detonate
  with a low roar at the height and distance the caster desires as
  long as it is within the spell’s maximum range. The explosion fills
  the area of effect, a 40 foot diameter sphere, with intense fire
  and heat, causing 1d6 +1 per level fire damage to all creatures
  and objects within the area. It ignites combustibles and damages
  objects, and melts anything with a low melting point such as
  bronze, copper, silver, lead or gold. The explosion creates almost
  no pressure. A small lump of coal is required to cast the spell.
<p>The fireball can detonate immediately in the same round that
the spell is cast, or the caster can choose to delay the explosion
for up to 5 rounds. The caster chooses the amount of delay upon
completing the spell, and the delay cannot be changed once it
has been set.</p>
<p>Unlike the fireball spell, impact against a solid barrier does not
  cause early detonation. If the caster chooses a delayed blast, the
  glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature
  can pick up and hurl the fireball like a rock. If the caster attempts
  to send the ball through a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit,
  the character must hit with a ranged attack roll, or else the bead
  strikes the barrier and falls to a resting point until detonation.</p>

  inaccuracies, or reveal evasions. Each round, the character may
  concentrate on a different subject. The reverse of this spell, hide
  lies, obscures the truthfulness of a person.

  With this spell, the caster learns the exact location of a person or
  object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection
  from scrying or location. The spell reveals the exact name and
  location (community, county, country, continent and plane)
  where the subject is to be found. To find a creature with the spell,
  the character must have seen the creature or have some item
  that once belonged to it. To find an object, the character must
  have seen or touched the object at least once. The reverse of
  this spell, hide location, obscures the location of a person or object
  from detection by spell, crystal ball, or other means of scrying.

  A thin green ray springs from the caster’s pointing finger,

  magical nature, but not a globe of invulnerability or an anti-magic

  This powerful spell rips asunder all magical effects within the
  spell’s 25 foot x foot area of effect. That is, spells and spell-like
  effects are separated into their individual components (ending
  the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and permanent magic
  items must make successful constitution saves or be turned
  into normal items. Even artifacts are subject to disjunction,
  though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually
  affecting such powerful items. If an artifact is destroyed by the
  spell, the caster must succeed at a charisma save or permanently
  lose all spell-casting abilities. The abilities cannot be recovered
by mortal magic, nor even by a wish. Destroying artifacts is a
dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention
of some powerful being who has an interest in, or connection
with, the device. When casting the spell at an anti-magic field,
the caster has a 1% chance per caster level of destroying it. If
the anti-magic field survives the disjunction, the items within it
are unaffected by the spell.

  within an area 30 feet x 30 feet x 30 feet. The caster must make

  of spells with instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because

items is suppressed for 1d4 rounds, but artifacts are unaffected.

maintained by an ongoing spell, such as a summoned monster,
is sent back to whence it came, because the spell that conjured
it ends. If an ongoing spell’s area overlaps that of the dispel,
the effect is ended only within the area of the dispel magic. The
caster automatically succeeds at the dispel check against their
own spells as long as the character is of the same or higher level

  illusion. As with limited wish, the caster must be careful in
  creating the illusion. The spell may duplicate the effects of any
  illusionist spell of 7th level or lower, any wizard spell of 5th level
  or lower or any cleric or druid spell of 4th level or lower. It may
  also grant other effects in line with the power of such spells,

  normal, except that all saves will always be against intelligence,
  not the designated attribute in the spell duplicated.

  This spell provides the caster with a useful piece of advice in reply
  to a question concerning a specific goal, event or activity that is
  to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short
  phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic riddle or omen. The
  Castle Keeper controls what information the character receives.
  It should be noted that if the caster’s party doesn’t act on the
  information, the conditions may change so that the information
  is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is
  70% + 1% per caster level. The Castle Keeper adjusts the chance
  if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, unusual
  precautions against divination spells have been taken). If the
  die roll fails, the character knows the spell failed, unless specific
  magic yielding false information is at work. Multiple divinations
  about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as
  the first divination and yield the same answer each time.

  believe they are in a dream, but instead believes they are
  awake and experiencing reality.
  <p>Once the illusionist has placed the victim in a comatose state,
  the illusionist has two options. The more powerful option
  requires the illusionist to keep touching the victim so as to
  successfully manipulate the magical dreams.</p>
  <p>If the illusionist ceases to touch the victim, the victim will
    remain comatose and unable to act or interact with anyone
    in any way until the spell ends or until they are successfully
    awakened by another. The victim can only be awakened if
    struck with a force that causes damage. If so struck, the victim
    is allowed an intelligence saving throw to awaken and come out
    of the dreaming.</p>
  <p>If the illusionist, however, has continued to touch the victim
since the spell began, then the victim cannot be awakened.
Instead, the illusionist convinces the victim that they have
awakened into a dream and then they slip back into a comatose
state.</p>
<p>  While continuing to touch the victim, the illusionist also can
  assault the victim’s mind with deadly attacks that cause damage
  or seek out information. The illusionist does so by casting spells
  into the dream. The spells are limited to those with verbal and/
  or somatic components only. If such a spell deals damage or
  death, the victim is allowed a normal saving throw to resist the
  spell’s effect. If the spell seeks information from the victim, which
  typically will require both the spell and role playing the dream
  encounter, the victim suffers a -6 to any allowed saving throw.</p>

  Drawing upon elemental forces, this spell creates an intense
  but highly localized tremor, within a 50 foot diameter circle,
  that ripples the ground, knocking creatures down, collapsing
  structures, and opening gaping fissures. The earthquake affects
  standing creatures in its area in a variety of ways.
  <p>All creatures standing in the area must make a dexterity save or
fall down. Even if they remain standing, they suffer a -10 penalty
to any actions attempted during the spell’s duration, and find it
impossible to move at more than half their normal speed, if at
all. All spellcasters standing in the area find it impossible to cast
spells while the earthquake is in effect, and lose any spells they
were in the process of casting.</p>
<p>Fissures rip open in the ground without warning, with a 25%
chance of opening beneath each creature in the area. Such
creatures must make dexterity saves to avoid falling into the
fissure, taking 1d6 damage if they fail. The worse threat, however,
is that all such fissures grind shut with impossible force at the end
of the round, crushing any trapped creatures to death.</p>

<p>The earthquake also has additional effects based on the terrain
it effects:</p>

<p> <b>Cave or Tunnel:</b> The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 damage to
any creature caught under the cave-in (dexterity save, half).</p>
<p> <b>Cliffs: </b>The cliff crumbles, causing a landslide that travels as
far horizontally as it fell vertically. An earthquake cast at the
top of a 100 foot cliff would sweep 100 foot outward from
the base of the cliff. Any creature in the path of the landslide
suffers 8d6 damage (dexterity save, half).</p>
<p> <b>River, Lake, or Marsh:</b> Fissures open underneath the
water, draining it away from the area to form a quagmire.
Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the
duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures.
All creatures in the area must make dexterity saves or sink
down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell,
the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained
water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>
<p> <b>Structure:</b> Most structures standing on open ground
collapse, dealing 8d6 damage to those caught in or beneath
the rubble (dexterity save, half).</p>

  affects a 25 foot x 25 foot area.
  <p>The caster may choose which emotion to inflict:</p>
<p> <b>Despair:</b> A lack of all hope crushes the targeted creatures’
morale. They suffer a -2 penalty to all saves, attacks, attribute
checks, ability checks and damage rolls. Despair dispels Hate.</p>
  <p> <b>Fear:</b> Fear of the caster grips the hearts of the targeted
  creatures. They flee as if subject to a fear spell. Fear dispels Rage.</p>
  <p> <b>Hate: </b>Fiery hate and bile rise in the targeted creatures.
  They react poorly to others and may become antagonistic
  or hostile. They gain a +2 bonus to saves, attacks, attribute
checks, ability checks and damage rolls. Hate dispels Despair.</p>
<p><b>Rage:</b> Sheer blind fury and wrath engulfs the targeted
creatures, and they are compelled to fight, heedless of danger.

  to effective dexterity, and cannot move, making the casting

  which detonate when they are read. The spell is used to protect
  and prevent access to a book, map, scroll, or similar object
  containing written information. When read, the runes explode
  causing 6d6 points of damage to the reader. The reader receives
  no saving throw. Creatures and objects within 10 feet of the
  blast must make a dexterity saving throw and suffer only half
  damage if successful. The book or other object upon which the
  runes are written also takes damage, and may be utterly ruined
  in the absence of some protection from magical fire.

<p>The caster, along with anyone else the caster chooses to specify,
may read the runes without triggering them. The caster can
also remove the runes at any time. Otherwise, the runes are
permanent until triggered or removed by dispel magic or other
counterspell.</p>

  Arcane energy forms into a phantom hound dedicated to
  guarding an area or the caster. The caster may order the
  hound to do either at any time during the spell’s duration.
  The hound will consider party members as allies unless
  ordered otherwise. Should a larger creature approach within
  50 feet, the hound immediately lets out a frightful and eerie
  howl. Those hearing the howl must save versus fear or suffer
  a -2 to attacks and morale. This also effects allies of the
  caster. If an intruder approaches to within 10 feet of the
  hound or caster, the guard dog ceases barking and attacks
  with a vicious bite. The hound’s bite is considered a magical
  weapon, and it attacks once per round. The hound gains a
  bonus to hit equal to the caster’s level, and it deals 2d6+3
  damage upon a successful bite. It continues to attack until
  the intruder retreats at least 25 feet away.
  <p>The most effective way to combat the hound is by dispelling it,
but it can be hurt by magic and weapons. The hound has an
armor class of 18 and as many hit points as the caster did when
the spell was cast. If the caster is ever more than 150 feet from the
hound, the spell ends. The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level,
but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per level.</p>

discretion. It affects a 20-foot diameter sphere.</p>

  This spell drains the target’s higher intellect, reasoning and even
  base cunning, reducing the target to an intelligence of 2, below
  that of even an animal. Still, even at such low intelligence,
  the spell’s target instinctively recognizes friends, and can
  follow them and protect them in a very primitive manner. The
  unfortunate victim remains in this state until a heal, restoration,
  wish, or equivalent are used to dispel it.

  With unerring instinct, the subject of this spell can locate the
  shortest, most direct physical route to a specified location on
  the same plane of existence, though this destination must be a
  location, not an object or creature. The character can even sense
  the correct direction that will eventually lead to the destination,
  indicating at the appropriate times the exact path to follow or
  physical actions to take, enabling the spell’s target to escape
  labyrinths, underground tunnel networks and mazes, magical or
  mundane. This spell also instantly counters and dispels the maze
  spell. The material component of the spell is a Y-shaped stick.

  <p>The reverse of this spell makes the subject lost, no matter

straying off the path. The subject can be led by someone else, or

  With a gesture, the caster sends a small ball of fire hurtling
  through the air to detonate with a low roar at the height and
  distance the caster desires, as long as it is within the spell’s
  maximum range. The explosion fills the area of effect with
  intense fire and heat, causing 1d6 damage per caster level to all
  creatures and objects within the area. It ignites combustibles,
  damages objects and melts anything with a low melting point
  such as bronze, copper, silver, lead or gold. The explosion
  creates almost no pressure. It affects a 40 foot diameter sphere.
  The material component is a small lump of coal.
  <p>The fireball follows a straight path, and if it impacts a solid
barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, the impact causes
early detonation. If the caster attempts to send the ball through
a narrow passage, such as an arrow slit, the character must hit
with a ranged attack roll, or else the bead strikes the barrier and
detonates prematurely.</p>

<div class="inner_box">
<p style="margin-left: 3px; margin-top: 3px;">
  A shimmering, mystical gate appears, hovering just above the ground.
  The gate is an inter-dimensional portal between the plane the caster
  is on and another plane of existence. The caster chooses which plane
  to connect to upon casting the spell, but must have some knowledge
  of the other plane. The gate can be used in two ways.
  <p>First, the gate may be used as a means of travel. Anything or
anyone moving through the gate instantly transports to the
other plane. The gate is 5 feet in diameter, but the caster can
increase the diameter by 1 foot per level. The caster may hold
the gate open for no more than 1 round per level, and must
concentrate to do so.</p>
<p>Second, the gate may be used to summon an individual
creature or type of creature from the plane to which the gate
is connected. The caster names the creature individually
or a specific creature type upon casting, and the gate opens
near the individual or creature. This spell does not give the
caster any control over creatures summoned through the gate.
The actions of a summoned creature vary depending upon
the situation, the caster’s motive, alignment and perhaps,
additional spells that may be active. Deities and other unique
entities are under no compulsion to come through the gate
unless they choose to. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases,
often to the detriment of the caster, and may return to its home
plane at any time. When used in this manner, the gate remains
open only until the summoned creature(s) passes through the
gate. Neither the caster nor anyone or anything on the caster’s
plane may enter the gate.</p>
<p>Typically, the caster will ask a summoned creature to perform a
service. It is easier to gain service from creatures weaker than the
caster. Deities and beings with a strong will are often ill-disposed
toward the caster for interfering with their life’s activities.</p>
<p>Even if a service is given, the creature may return to its home
plane, at will, whether the service is completed or not, unless
the caster has used some other spell to bind the creature and
force servitude. Contractual service is entirely more involved,
but more likely beneficial for the caster, because the summoned
creature is less likely to be ill disposed towards its summoner
when some form of recompense is offered. The negotiation of a
contract must be roleplayed, bearing in mind the nature of the
creature, its desires, and its intellect; few such creatures have
any need for gold or coin, and their desires may seem alien at
best, or utterly vile. Some creatures may attempt to subvert
their contract, especially if they feel they have been tricked or
treated poorly, interpreting a contract in ways that will hopefully
cause the caster distress or peril.</p>
<p>Failure to fulfil a contract on the caster’s part can have terrible
consequences. A creature, its liege, or master may all attempt
to enact some measure of revenge at some time. Or, if the caster
violates his alignment or code, or fails to uphold a sworn oath,
the caster’s deity may impose some penalty or dishonor.</p>

“Do as I desire or suffer the consequences” is the essence of this
  spell. The caster places a magical command on the spell’s target,
  through means that are magical, divine and mental, to carry out
  some quest or service, or to refrain from some activity or course
  of action. If the geased individual fails to do as instructed, they
  sicken and will most likely die. A geas must be carefully worded
  by the caster, or it may lead to a quest with a goal not intended,
  or the spell may simply fail altogether. The caster of the geas may
  release the affected creature from it at any time.
  <p>Although a geas can command almost any course of activity,
it cannot compel a creature to commit suicide or perform
acts that would result in certain death. The creature affected
must be able to understand the caster’s command, or the spell
fails. A geased creature is bound with the spell until the task is
completed, no matter how long it takes, but if the instructions
involve an open-ended task that the character cannot complete
through its own actions, the spell ends after one day.</p>
<p>If a creature ignores the geas, or is prevented from obeying
it, they suffer consequences. A creature will lose 1 point of
strength and suffer a -1 penalty to all saving throws for every
day during which the quest is not undertaken. If they again
take up the quest, the penalties cease. If a creature ignores a
quest for 5 days in a row, they must make a constitution save or
sicken. A sickened character moves at half normal speed, suffers
a -4 penalty on constitution and dexterity, heals no damage
naturally, and cannot benefit from magical healing.</p>
<p>A sickened character must also again make a constitution
save after a number of days have passed equal to the creature’s
normal constitution score. Failure means the creature is
disabled, unable to move or act beyond a crawl. All of these
effects end 1 day after the character deliberately attempts to
resume the quest.</p>
<p>A geas and its effects can be removed magically by remove curse
(but only if the caster of the remove curse is at least two levels
higher than the level of the character who cast the geas , and the
caster of the remove curse makes a successful charisma check),
or a wish. Dispel magic does not affect a geas.</p>

  Eerie rattles and wails, wolfish howls, warm laughter, quiet
  conversation, the rumble of thunder and clash of swords, the

  To cast a glyph of warding, the caster inscribes an area or object
  with an invisible inscription that harms those who enter,
  pass, open the warded area or object, or otherwise break the
  conditions of the ward set by the caster. It can encompass an
  area up to 25 feet x 25 feet. An ounce of oil (1sp) mixed with
  incense (5sp) and a powdered gemstone of color appropriate to
  the caster’s deity (200gp) is needed to activate the spell. Glyphs
  can be set to permit or ward against a specific individual or
  individuals, or even entire species or groups of species. They can
  be set to admit only characters of certain faiths or alignments,
  or carrying certain items, wearing certain garments, colors, or
  signs or uttering certain passwords. Any creature violating the
  warded area is subject to its magic.

  <p>Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally, but can be
fooled by polymorph and non detection spells, and they are not
triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple
glyphs cannot be cast on the same area or object, although more
than one glyphed object may be placed in close proximity. A
glyph can be made to conform to any shape, up to the limitations
of the spell’s area.</p>

<p>Read magic permits a character to see a glyph, and a successful
intelligence check allows the same character to identify the
glyph. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows
the character to know the basic nature of the glyph. Glyphs are
affected by dispel magic. Depending on the version selected, a
glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell:</p>

<p> <b>Blast Glyph:</b> This glyph causes 1d4 damage per caster
level to the intruder and all within 5 feet of the intruder. A
successful Wis save reduces damage by one-half. Damage
may be either from acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic, as
determined by caster. Because the damage is entirely divine,
however, the type of damaging agent has no secondary effect.</p>
<p> <b>Spell Glyph:</b> Stores any single spell of up to 3rd level that
the caster knows. The spell must be cast as part of the process
of inscribing the glyph. When it is violated, the spell operates
as if the caster cast it at that time, allowing normal saves as
per the spell.</p>

  The caster shapes quasi-real illusions, resembling monsters, that
  can attack the caster’s foes. The shadow conjurations remain
  semi-solid, even to those who disbelieve them. The caster can
  create one or more illusions whose total HD are equal to the
  caster’s level. The caster chooses what form the illusions take,
  be they goblin, orc or lion, but size is restricted to medium or
  small. The shadow creatures have only 40% of the normal or
  maximum hit points of a creature of the chosen type.

  Characters interacting with these illusions believe them to be
real creatures, unless they make a successful intelligence save.
If the saving throw fails, the creatures deal normal damage and
have all the normal abilities and weaknesses of a creature of
that type. If the saving throw succeeds, the creatures’ special
abilities, armor class, damage and all other aspects will be only
40% as strong as the real thing. Those who succeed at their
saves see the conjurations as transparent images superimposed
on vague, shadowy forms.

  This mighty spell is a useful tool in the defense of towers,
  strongholds, and other dwellings. The caster must be somewhere
  within the area being warded to cast the spell. The spell radiates
  out and away from the caster in a 20 foot/level diameter sphere,
  creating the effects detailed below within the building. The whole
  warded area radiates magic with incredible intensity. A dispel magic
  cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A
  successful disjunction destroys the entire guards and wards spell.
  <p>1. Any creature facing a choice in direction, such as a corridor
  intersection or side passage, becomes subject to a minor
  confusion-type effect, making it 50% likely that they will
  believe they are going in the exact opposite direction from
  the one they actually chose. SR: Yes.</p>
<p> 2. All corridors within the area of the spell fill with an eerie
  fog, obscuring all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5
  feet. A creature within 5 feet has one-half concealment;
  creatures farther away have full concealment. SR: No.</p>
<p> 3. All doors are subjected to the lock spell (see knock). SR:
No.</p>
<p>4. One door per caster level is covered by an illusion to appear
as if it were a plain wall, and may only be detected with a
successful intelligence (disbelief) save. SR: No.</p>
<p>5. Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom, the strands identical
to those of the web spell, except that they regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while the guards
and wards spell is in effect. SR: No.</p>
<p>6. The caster may also select one of the following:
a. A gust of wind in one corridor or room. SR: No.
b. A magic mouth in two places. SR: No.
c. A stinking cloud in two places. The vapors appear and
linger in the places the caster designates; they return
within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the guards
and wards spell lasts. SR: Yes.</p>

<p>d. A suggestion in one place. The caster selects a 10
square foot area (or less), and any creature who enters
or passes through the area receives the suggestion
mentally. SR: Yes.</p>
<p>e. Dancing lights in four corridors. The character can
designate a simple routine that the lights will repeat
for as long as the guards and wards spell lasts. SR: No.</p>

  This spell sanctifies a large 150 foot radius area of a holy site.
  The spell has four effects.

  <p>First, the entire area operates as a magic circle against evil
  (or good, chaos or law, as chosen by the caster). All warded
  creatures in the area receive a +2 bonus to armor class and
  saves against attacks by creatures of the selected alignment.
  Likewise, the spell blocks any attempt to possess or mentally
  control a warded creature, and prevents bodily contact by
  summoned or conjured creatures. The protection against
  contact by summoned or conjured creatures ends if a warded
  individual makes an attack against such a creature. Spell
  resistance can allow a summoned creature to overcome this
  protection and touch the warded creature. These effects are
  not cumulative with protection from evil.</p>

  <p>Second, all attempts to turn undead gain a +3 bonus. Attempts
to command undead suffer a -3 penalty.</p>

<p>Third, any dead body interred in a hallowed site cannot be
turned into an undead creature.</p>

<p>Fourth, the character may choose to affix a single spell effect
to the hallowed site. The character must cast the spell when
casting hallow. The spell effect lasts for one year and functions
throughout the entire consecrated site, regardless of its
normal duration and area of effect. The caster may designate
whether the effects apply to all creatures, or only to creatures
who share the character’s faith or alignment. At the end of
the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or
replaced simply by casting hallow again. Spell effects that may
be tied to a hallowed site include aid, bless, cause fear, detect evil
(good, chaos, law), detect magic, dispel magic, endure elements,
freedom of movement, protection from elements, remove fear, resist
elements, silence and tongues.</p>

against good creatures. Any dead body buried in an unhallowed
area, however, will rise as a zombie in 24 hours.</p>

assumes the risk of permanent bodily damage from the strain of
the spell. At the end of the spell’s duration, an affected creature
must make a successful constitution saving throw or lose 1 hit
point permanently.

<p>Slow is the reverse of haste. It reduces by ½ a creature’s
movement and number of attacks per round. A creature affected
by slow suffers no aging or other bodily strain. Haste dispels and
counters slow, and vice-versa.</p>

  This powerful curative enables the caster to wipe away
  disease and injury. It completely cures all hit point damage,
  all diseases, blindness, deafness and all temporary ability
  damage. It neutralizes poisons in the subject’s system, so that
  no additional damage or effects are suffered. It nullifies a
  feeblemind spell. It cures mental disorders caused by nature,
  spell, or injury to the brain. Heal does not remove negative
  levels, restore permanently drained levels, or restore
  permanently drained ability scores. The reverse of the spell,
  harm, drains the target of all but 4 hit points and causes
  disease in the subject (see remove disease).
  <p>A heal spell cast upon an undead creature affects it as if the
harm spell were cast upon it. A harm spell cast upon an undead
creature affects it as if a heal spell were cast.</p>
<p>The illusionist version of the spell acts in the same manner with
two important exceptions. The spell recipient of the spell must
make an intelligence saving throw. If the creature fails the saving
throw, the spell acts normally. If the creature makes the saving
throw, the spell fails as the creature realizes that the spell is an
illusion. Also, the illusionist version has no effect on undead.</p>

  This spell raises the temperature of metal items, such as
  weapons and armor, while its reverse, chill metal, lowers the
  temperature. Magical metal items are not affected. The spell
  affects the equipment of one creature per two caster levels and
  the creatures can be no more than 25 feet apart. If the metal
  targeted is not held or worn, the the amount affected is 25
  pounds per level.
  <p>This spell lasts for 7 rounds. On the first and seventh round of
the spell, the metal becomes warm or chilly, and uncomfortable
to touch but deals no damage. During the second and sixth
rounds, burning heat or icy coldness causes pain and 1d4
damage. In the third, fourth and fifth rounds, the metal is
searing hot or freezing cold, causing disabling pain and 2d4
damage per round. The disabling pain results in the hands and/
or body becoming totally disabled for 1-4 days.</p>

<p>Any heat or cold intense enough to damage the creature negates
heat or cold damage from this spell (and vice versa) on a pointfor-
point basis. Underwater, heat metal deals half damage and
boils the surrounding water, and chill metal deals no damage,
but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it
more buoyant.</p>

  to the discretion of the Castle Keeper. The Castle Keeper
  may allow additional intelligence saves for the subject if the
  suggestion is less than reasonable. Even once the spell ends, an
  affected creature retains its new attitude toward the caster, but

  This spell writes instructions or other information on any suitable
  writing material. The script appears to be some form of foreign
  or magic writing. Only the person (or people) designated by the
  character at the time of the casting are able to read the writing.
  The script is completely unintelligible to any other character,
  although an illusionist will recognize it as illusory script.
  <p>Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers
  a potent illusory effect and must make an intelligence saving
  throw, or become subject to a suggestion implanted in the script
  by the caster. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes.</p>
  <p>If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and
  its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read
  by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or
  comprehend languages spell. The casting time depends on the
  length of the message written, but it is always at least 1 minute.</p>

  This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling or similar
  surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical
  objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell
  is used to hide pits, traps or normal doors, any detection
  abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touching
or probing the surface reveals its illusory nature, though that
does not cause the illusion to disappear. It effects an area 10
feet x 10 feet x 1 foot.

  This spell requires a successful touch attack to affect the target,
  who is then entombed, in a state of suspended animation in
  a small sphere, far beneath the surface of the earth. For the
  victim, time ceases to flow. The creature does not grow older,
  its body functions virtually cease, it does not need food or
  water and no force or effect can harm it. Most divinations will
  not reveal the creature but discern location does. The subject
  remains entombed unless the reverse of this spell, freedom, is
  cast where the imprisonment took place. A wish spell will
  not free a creature but will reveal where it is entombed. The
  imprisonment spell functions only if the target’s name and some
  facts about its life are known.

  A horde of insects swarm forth from the spell’s point of origin, in a

  and spellcasting within the cloud is impossible. Creatures inside

  the end of each round they remain within it. All creatures with
  2 or fewer HD are driven from the cloud at their fastest possible
  speed in a random direction, and flee until they are at least 100
  feet away from the insects. Creatures with 3 to 5 HD flee as well,
  unless they succeed at a charisma saving throw.
  <p>The horde of insects does not move from the targeted area of

torch is ineffective against the horde. Lightning, cold, and ice
are ineffective, but a strong wind (21+ mph), that covers the

  This spell allows the caster to summon one pre-prepared item
  from virtually any location directly to the caster’s hand. Unless
  it is the caster’s personal staff, the item cannot weigh more than
  10 pounds and cannot be over 6 feet in length, width, or depth.
  The caster places a personal mark on the item, and casts the
  spell on a gem worth at least 2,500 gp, which magically and
  invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the gem. Thereafter,
  the character can summon the item by speaking a special word
  set by the character when the spell is cast, and crushing the
  gem. The item appears instantly in the caster’s hand. Only the
  original caster can use the gem in this way. If the item is in
  the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but
  the caster immediately knows who the possessor is, and roughly
  where he, she, or it is located when the summons is cast. The
  item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other
  creature has claimed ownership of it.

  as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests, and also
  loosens shackles or chains that have been employed to hold
  closures shut. Non-magical items opened by a knock spell
  do not lock by themselves once opened. Knock can not
  raise portcullises or similar impediments, nor can it undo
  or untangle knots. Each spell can undo up to two means
  of preventing egress through a portal. If used to open a
  magically locked closure, knock does not remove the spell
  but simply inhibits its functioning for 10 minutes.
  <p>Lock is the reverse of knock. It magically locks a single portal,
chest or box, preventing it from being opened by any mundane
means short of breaking or bypassing the portal itself; any
magical means of opening, such as dispel magic or knock work
normally. The caster can freely pass the character’s own lock
without affecting it.</p>

  Great deeds, events and powers are writ large in legend, and
  with this spell the caster can draw upon these great tales,
  bringing to light knowledge about a legendary person, place or
  thing. If the person or thing is close at hand, or if the caster
  is in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 x 10
  minutes. If the caster only possesses detailed information on
  the person, place or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and
  the resulting knowledge gleaned is less complete and specific.
  If the caster knows little beyond rumor, the casting time is 2d6
  weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete. However
  it may enable the caster to locate more detailed information.
  While casting this spell, the caster cannot engage in anything
  other than routine activities such as sleeping and eating. When
  completed, the spell brings the legends, if any exist, about the
  individual, location or thing to the caster’s mind.
  <p>The tales reveal themselves as long-forgotten and sometimes
cryptic memories, riddles or rhymes, regardless of whether the
legends are current, long forgotten or obscure. Subjects lacking
legendary importance provide no information whatsoever. As a
rule of thumb, characters of 10th level and higher are legendary,
as are the sorts of creatures they strive against, the major
magical items they wield, and the places where they performed
their great or nefarious deeds.</p>

  The caster unleashes a blinding, sizzling arc of forking electricity
  that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level. The caster
  channels the electricity through a small iron rod (1sp) that has
  been left out in a thunderstorm. The bolt is 10 feet wide x 50
  feet long or 5 feet wide x 100 feet long. The bolt erupts from
  the caster’s fingertips, staff, rod or wand. It strikes creatures

  to either side, igniting combustibles, sundering wooden doors
  and melting metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold,
  copper, silver or bronze.

  Though the scope of the wish granted by this potent spell may
  be limited, much can be accomplished by the imaginative caster
  within its strict bounds. This spell may duplicate the effects of
  any wizard spell of 6th level or lower, any illusionist spell of 5th
  level or lower or any cleric or druid spell of 4th level or lower. It
  may also grant other effects in line with the power of such spells,
  although any effects must be approved by the Castle Keeper.
  The caster must be cautious in phrasing the spell though, for
  the desires of the greedy often end in disaster, and the spell
  is very literal in its fulfilment of the caster’s wish. Duplicated
  spells allow saving throws and spell resistance as normal.

  With this spell, the caster need never fear misplacing his tower
  key again, for it enables the caster to sense the direction of a wellknown
  or clearly visualized object, including apparel, jewelry,
  furniture, tools, weapons or even such mundane implements as
  a ladder. All the caster needs is a small 2gp glass lens or opaque
  crystal. The spell may be used to search for general items such
  as a stairway, a sword or a jewel, in which case the spell locates
  the nearest such object within its range, or the spell may be used
  to find a specific item, such as a particular piece of jewelry. A
  unique object (such as Gideon Thorne’s gold-plated quill) may not
  be located unless the caster has observed that particular item
  first-hand. The spell is blocked by lead, fooled by polymorphing,
  and cannot detect creatures.

<p>Obscure object, the reverse of this spell, may be cast on an object,
thereby preventing it from being located by spells of this type, or
by divinatory means such as scrying, for the duration of the spell.</p>

  This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject, to a
  distance of 10 feet, that offers protection against one axis of
  alignment (evil, good, chaos, or law) which is decided at the
time of casting. Only one such protective spell can be in effect
in one place at the same time, even if each protects against a
different alignment.

<p>The barrier moves with the subject and grants a +2 bonus to
armor class and saving throws against creatures of the chosen
alignment. The spell prevents bodily contact by summoned or
conjured creatures of any alignment: the melee attacks of such
creatures fail and the creatures recoil from the protective magic.
The protection against contact by summoned or conjured
creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against,
or tries to force the barrier against, the blocked creature. Spell
resistance can allow a summoned or conjured creature to
overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>

<p>The magical circle also blocks any attempt to possess or
exercise mental control over the warded creature by foes of
any alignment. The protection does not prevent casting a spell
that gains mental control, but it prevents the caster of such
a spell from mentally commanding the protected creature. If
the protection ends before the mental control does, the enemy
caster would then be able to exercise such mental control of the
creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force
but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.</p>


<p>This spell has a special function that the character may choose
when casting the spell. A magic circle can be focused inward
rather than outward. In this case, it serves as an immobile,
temporary magical prison for a summoned creature. The
creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. The caster must
beat a creature’s SR in order to keep it at bay, but the bonuses
and the protection from mental control apply regardless of an
enemy’s SR. If a creature is too large to fit into the spell’s area,
the spell succeeds but for that creature only.</p>

  By casting magic jar, the caster places their own soul into a
  gem or large crystal, which must be of at least 1000gp in value,
  leaving the caster’s own body lifeless. The caster may then
  attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing the target’s
  soul into the magic jar.
  <p>While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life
force on the same plane within 10 feet per caster level. The
caster, however, cannot determine the exact creature types or
positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, the caster
can sense a difference of four or more HD and can determine
whether a life force is positive or negative energy. Attempting
to possess a body is an attack, and it is blocked by protection from
evil or a similar ward.</p>

<p>The caster possesses the body and forces the creature’s soul into
the magic jar unless the subject succeeds at a charisma save.
Failure to take over the host leaves the caster’s life force in
the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds at further
saving throws if the caster attempts to possess its body again.</p>


<p>If successful, the caster’s life force occupies the host body, and
the host’s life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster
keeps his or her intelligence, wisdom, charisma, level, class,
base attack bonus, prime attributes, alignment, and mental
abilities while the host body retains its strength, dexterity,
constitution, hit points, natural abilities and extraordinary
abilities such as water breathing or regeneration. A body with
extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks
(or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.
The caster can’t choose to activate the body’s extraordinary
or supernatural abilities. The creature’s spells and spell-like
abilities do not stay with the body.</p>

<p>The caster may move back to the jar, returning the trapped soul
to its body, at any time; and may thereafter attempt to possess
another body. The spell ends when the caster chooses to return
to the caster’s own body (leaving the receptacle empty).</p>

<p>To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range. When
the caster’s soul transfers to the jar, the caster’s original body is,
as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p>

<p>If the host body is slain the caster returns to the magic jar, if
within range, and the life force of the host dies. If the host body
is slain beyond the range of the spell, both the caster and the
host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p>
<p>At the end of the spell, the caster’s soul returns to the caster’s
body, regardless of whether the soul is in the magic jar or a
host body. Should a host’s soul be in the magic jar at the end
of the spell, the soul returns to the host’s body. However,
if the caster’s soul or the host’s soul is too far distant from
its body, then the caster or host, possibly both, will die.
Destroying the receptacle ends the spell. A magic jar may
also be dispelled by casting a dispel magic (or greater) spell on
either the receptacle or the host.</p>

  The group of creatures targeted vanish from sight, even from
  darkvision, deepvision, and twilight vision. If the recipients are
  carrying gear, the gear vanishes too. Individuals in the group
  cannot see each other, unless they can normally see invisible
  things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by
  an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if
  tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light,
  however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can
  (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any
  part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more
  than 10 feet from it becomes visible, such as a trailing rope.
  <p>The subjects are not magically silenced, and certain other
conditions can render the recipients detectable (such as stepping
in a puddle). The spell ends if anyone in the group attacks any
creature, including casting a spell targeting a foe or whose area
or effect includes a foe. Actions directed at unintended objects
do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack.
If the subject attacks directly it becomes visible immediately
along with all its gear. Note that spells specifically affecting
allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when
they include foes in their area.</p>
<p>The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than
180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two
individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other
one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each
other, they both become visible when the distance between
them exceeds 180 feet.)</p>

  The spell is the same as suggestion except that this spell can
  affect more creatures. The caster influences the actions of
  the creatures by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a
  sentence or two). The number of creatures affected is equal to
  one per level of the caster and all must be within a 25 foot area.
  The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make
  the activity sound reasonable. The victim must understand the
  language of the caster making the suggestion. Any attempt to
  suggest an act that would be harmful to the victim or something
  severely at odds with their behavior will allow the affected
  creature to automatically break the enchantment. The Castle
  Keeper is free to factor in penalties to the victim’s saving throw
  for quite reasonable suggestions as well as give the target
  bonuses to their saves for unreasonable or harmful suggestions.

  <p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire
duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what he was asked
to do. The caster can instead specify conditions that will triggers
a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met
before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.</p>

  exits the stone, the caster is expelled.

  <p>Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm the caster, but
  its partial destruction, to the extent that the caster no longer fits
  within it, expels the caster and deals 5d6 damage. The stone’s
  complete destruction expels and slays the caster instantly unless
  a successful constitution save is made at +3. The following
  spells cause harm to the caster if cast upon the stone: stone to
  flesh expels the caster and deals 5d6 damage; stone shape deals
  3d6 damage but does not expel the character; transmute rock to

  The caster may choose either four large 2-foot diameter or eight

  This spell creates the illusion of an object, creature or force as
  visualized by the caster. Its area of effect is a 40 foot cube + 10
  cubic feet per level. The spell includes some minor sounds, but
  not understandable speech. The illusion does not create smell,
  texture or temperature. The caster’s can move the image within
  the limits of the spell’s area of effect. The image persists for 2
  rounds after the caster’s concentration ceases.
  Creatures who view the illusion believe it, and can suffer
  damage from it. The image disappears if the viewer makes a
  saving throw.

  This spell is like hallucinatory terrain, but it can effect or add
  man-made structures to the illusion. The area of effect is 10
  square feet per level. The caster makes natural terrain look,
sound, feel and smell like some other sort of natural terrain.
Structures in the area can be altered to look different, or illusory
structures can be added. Items and creatures within the area are
not hidden or changed in appearance, although they can hide
within the illusion as if it were real.
<p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile and olfactory
elements. The illusion persists until dispelled or disbelieved
by an intelligent creature and requires an appropriate piece of
terrain to mimic.</p>

  Illusory duplicates of the caster pop into being and mimic the
  caster’s actions, making it difficult for enemies to know which
  target to attack. The spell creates 1d4+1 images. The images
  stay near the caster and disappear when struck. The images
  remain in a cluster or form a line, each within 5 feet of at least
  one other figment or the caster. Observers can’t use vision or
  hearing to tell which one is the caster and which the image.
  Enemies attempting to attack the caster or cast spells at the
  caster must select from among indistinguishable targets.
  <p>Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is
real or a figment. Any successful attack roll against a figment
destroys it. A figment’s armor class is equal to the caster’s. An
attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled.</p>

  An illusory double of the caster appears, and at the same time,
  the caster is affected as if by an invisibility spell. The caster is
  free to go elsewhere while the caster’s double moves away. The
  double appears within the spell’s range, but thereafter moves
  according to the caster’s intent at the time of casting. The
  caster can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly
  over the character’s own body so that observers don’t notice an
  image appearing and the caster turning invisible. The caster and
  the figment can then move in different directions. The double
  moves at the caster’s speed, can talk and gesture as if it were

  This spell moves dirt, possibly collapsing embankments, moving
  hillocks, shifting dunes, etc. Rock formations cannot be moved.
  The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every
  10 foot x 10 foot area, casting takes 3 minutes. The maximum
  area, 800 feet by 800 feet, takes 4 hours to move. The earth
  moved cannot exceed 10 feet in depth. Casting the spell requires
  a handful of earth and a wand, rod or staff.
  <p>This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground.
Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, the earth
reacting with glacier-like fluidity until the desired result is
achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations and such are
mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative
topography. The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is
generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use
is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours
before a battle. </p>

  damage or effects from the poison, and any temporary effects
  are ended. But the spell does not reverse effects the poison may

  ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own.
  <p>This spell also neutralizes the poison in a poisonous creature or
object. A poisonous creature replenishes its poison at its normal rate.</p>

important exception. The spell recipient of the spell must make an
intelligence saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw, the

  The caster sends a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to
  a single specific creature whom the caster names or specifically
  designates. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes
  1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the subject
  tired and unrested, and unable to regain arcane spells for the
  next 24 hours. Dispel evil cast on the subject while the caster
  is casting the spell dispels the nightmare and stuns the caster
  for 10 minutes per caster level of the dispel evil. If the recipient
  is awake when the spell begins, the caster can choose to cease
  casting (ending the spell) or enter a trance until the recipient
  goes to sleep, whereupon the caster becomes alert again and
  completes the casting. If the caster is disturbed during the
  trance, the spell ends. If the caster chooses to enter a trance, the
  caster is not aware of the caster’s surroundings or the activities
  around the caster while in the trance. The caster is defenseless,
  both physically and mentally, while in the trance. Creatures
  who don’t sleep or dream are immune to this spell.

  This powerful spell makes certain other spells permanent,
  assuming that the caster has attained a required level of
  experience and is otherwise able to cast the spell to be made
  permanent. Making spells permanent results in the temporary
  loss of 1 point of constitution for 1 month, with the caster
needing to make a constitution saving throw to prevent the loss
from remaining permanent.
<p>The caster can make any of these spells permanent in regard
to the character’s person: comprehend languages, detect magic,
detect poison, endure elements, protection from arrows, read magic,
see invisibility, tongues, and water breathing. This application of
permanency can be dispelled only by a caster of greater level
than the caster was when he or she cast the spell.</p>
<p>In addition to personal use, permanency can be used to make
the following spells permanent on the caster, another creature,
an object, or an area (as appropriate): alarm, confusion,
dancing lights, enlarge, ghost sound, gust of wind, invisibility, magic
mouth, phase door, prismatic sphere, scare, stinking cloud, symbol,
teleportation circle, wall of fire, wall of force, and web. Spells cast
on other creatures, objects or locations (instead of the caster)
are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal.</p>
<p>The Castle Keeper may allow other selected spells to be made
permanent, based on an appropriate amount of time and money
spent researching this application of a given spell. If the Castle
Keeper has already determined that the application is not
possible, the research automatically fails.</p>

  the most horrific creature imaginable. This creature is the
  formulation of all the subconscious fears of the target, brought
  into a very convincing and deadly illusion. Only the caster and

  illusory attack upon the target, who must make a successful
  intelligence saving throw or instantly die from fear and psychic
  damage. A successful saving throw results in 4d6 damage.

all physical barriers to reach the target. The killer cannot pass
through magical protections such as a globe of invulnerability, or
through any area of anti-magic.</p>

effect reaches the target, the spell ends. In rare circumstances,

  This spell causes normal vegetation within range to become
  thick and overgrown. The plants intertwine to form a thicket or
  jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed
  drops to 10 feet per round for man-sized or smaller creatures, or
  20 feet per round for larger creatures. The Castle Keeper may
  allow faster movement for very small or very large creatures. The
  area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect.
  The new growth is permanent unless destroyed or dispelled. At
  the caster’s option, the area can be a circle with a radius of 100
  feet, a semicircle with a radius of 150 feet or a quarter circle
  with a radius of 200 feet. The caster may also designate areas
  within the area that are not affected.
  <p>Alternately, plant growth can be used to create a 50%
improvement in the vitality and production of all crops within a
two mile radius of the caster. This usage can affect a given area
only once per year.</p>

  While this spell can operate as a more powerful version of
  polymorph other, it is not restricted to transforming creatures.
  Objects and creatures targeted by this spell can be transformed
  into any other creature or object the caster desires. For example,
  this spell could be used to change a needle into a sword, a beetle
  into a dragon, a chair into a dwarf or a kobold into a horseshoe.
  The duration of the spell is determined by the degree of change
  enacted. This spell cannot be used to create magic items.
  <p>  An unwilling living target is entitled to a wisdom saving throw
    to resist the effects of the spell. If the form assumed is inanimate,
    creatures are placed in a state of suspended animation until
    either the spell expires or until dispel magic is cast. A living
    creature polymorphed into the form of another living creature
    risks assuming the consciousness of the new form as detailed in
    polymorph other, and the other details of that spell apply as well. Use
    of the spell in that manner has a permanent duration, unless the
    size changed into is more than double the creature’s normal height.
    If more than double, the spell lasts 12 hours. Upon changing, the
    creature regains 1d4 hit points. If slain, the creature reverts to his
    or her original form, but remains dead.</p>
  <p>  The change is permanent for inanimate objects changed into
    other inanimate objects as long as the general size and volume
    remains the same or less. Changing an object into a larger size
    results in the spell lasting 12 hours. Changing a creature into an
    object, or vice-versa, results in the spell lasting 1d4 hours if the
    size and volume remains the same or less. Changing creatures
    into larger sizes results in the spell lasting only 1d4 x 10 minutes.</p>
  <p>
    This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of polymorph
    other, transmute flesh and stone, transmute mud and rock, and
    transmute metal and wood.</p>

  The caster causes another creature to assume the body, abilities
  and potentially the consciousness of another form of another
  creature. An unwilling target gets a wisdom save to resist the
  spell. Additionally, a creature polymorphed into the form of
  another risks assuming the consciousness of the new form. For
  every 12 hours spent in the new form, the creature must succeed
  at a wisdom save or become a member of the species in question
  in both form and consciousness, forgetting everything associated
  with the prior form, including friends, family, experiences and
  training. If the magic is dispelled, the target regains its former
  memories and personality.
  <p>In all other regards, this spell acts like polymorph self. Size can
be no larger than twice the creature’s normal height. The caster
retains control over both minor and significant physical qualities.
Upon changing back to an original form, the polymorphed
creature regains 1d4 hit points. If slain, the creature reverts to
his or her original form, but remains dead.</p>

  The caster takes the form of another creature. The new form
  can range in size from as small as a hummingbird to a size up to
  twice the caster’s normal height. A polymorphed character can
  be changed into a member of his or her own species. The caster
  can change his or her form as often as desired during the spell’s
  duration. Each transformation takes one round.
  <p>The polymorphed caster acquires the physical and natural
abilities of the new form while retaining his or her own mental
abilities and limitations. Physical and natural abilities include
the natural size, armor class, natural weapon attack types
and damage and similar physical qualities such as mundane
movement capabilities (like flying or swimming), and vision
capabilities. Physical and natural abilities do not include magical
flight and other magical forms of travel, spell-like abilities,
supernatural abilities or other extraordinary abilities.</p>
  <p>Moreover, a caster does not gain the ability to make more
attacks than is normal for the character just because the
creature type transformed and naturally has extra limbs, wings,
or a tail. For example, a caster capable of one attack per round
might polymorph into a lion. A lion can make three attacks per
round - bite, and two claws. The caster polymorphed into a lion,
however, may make only one attack although the caster may choose either a bite or a claw attack. If the attack succeeds, the
damage inflicted is normal for a lion.</p>
<p>The caster can freely designate the new form’s minor physical
qualities such as hair color, hair texture and skin color within
the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form’s
significant physical qualities such as height, weight and gender
are also under the caster’s control, but must fall within the
norms for the new form’s species.</p>
<p>Unlike physical abilities, the caster retains his own mental
abilities, prime attribute designations when applicable to the new
form, level and class, hit points, alignment and class to hit bonus.
If the new form possesses strength, dexterity and/or constitution
attributes, the new scores are applied and thus may affect attack
bonuses and attribute checks. The character retains his or her
own type, extraordinary abilities, spells and spell-like abilities. A
character that can cast spells needs a humanlike voice for verbal
components and humanlike hands for somatic components.</p>
<p>When the polymorph occurs, the caster’s equipment, if any,
transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature
that does not use equipment, the equipment melds into the new
form and becomes nonfunctional. Components and foci melded
in this way cannot be used to cast spells. If the new form uses
equipment, the caster’s equipment changes to match the new
form and retains its properties. Incorporeal and gaseous forms
cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>Upon changing back to his original form, the caster regains 1d4
hit points. If slain, the character reverts to his or her original
form, but remains dead.</p>
<p>Common sense must be applied when a polymorph spell comes
into play. The above spell descriptions should adequately
address most uses of the polymorph spells. In those other
unique instances, the Castle Keeper should utilize the above as
a guideline for issuing rulings on the spell’s effect to the players.</p>

  simple magical effects. This spell can clean, soil, or alter the
  color of items in a 1-foot cube. It can chill, warm or flavor 1
  pound of non living material. It can move up to 1 pound of
  matter. It can create effects like a puff of smoke, very minor
  illusions, sound effects or temporary change in color. This
  spell can never inflict damage or disrupt the casting of other
  spellcasters. Prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any
  other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just
  moving, cleaning or soiling it) persists for only 1 hour.

  This powerful spell conjures up an immobile, opaque globe of
  shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds and protects the
  caster from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in seven
colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The
caster can pass in and out of the sphere without harm. Typically,
only the upper hemisphere of the globe is seen because the
caster is at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is beneath
ground level.
<p>The sphere blocks any attempt to project something through
it, including spells. Other creatures, who may attempt to attack
the caster through the sphere or pass through it, suffer the
effects of each color, one at a time.</p>
<p>Any creature with fewer than 8 HD within 20 feet of the sphere
that gazes directly upon it is blinded for 2d4 minutes by the
colors. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the
sphere, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures
trying to attack the caster or pass through the sphere and the
magic needed to negate each color.</p>

<p>The sphere can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive
order, by various magical effects; however, the first must be
brought down before the second can be affected, and so on.
A rod of cancellation or a disjunction spell destroys a prismatic
sphere, but dispel magic can only work against the violet globe.
Spell resistance is effective against a prismatic sphere, but the
check must be repeated for each color present.</p>

<p>The area of effect for this spell is a 20-foot diameter sphere.</p>

  This spell creates the illusion of an object, creature or force, as
  visualized by the caster. Sound, smell and thermal illusions may
  be all included in the spell effect. Creatures who view the illusion
  believe it, and can suffer damage from illusions. Hit point damage
  is suffered from damage to the mind/psyche. The illusion activates
  when a specific condition occurs, chosen when the spell is cast.
  The trigger can be based upon any condition normally obvious to
  the senses. The illusion follows a script determined by the caster
  without requiring the caster’s concentration, and can include
  intelligible speech if the caster wishes. The image disappears if an
  opponent makes the saving throw.

  Upon casting this spell, the caster weaves a shadow duplicate
  of himself. The image is intangible, but looks, sounds and
  smells like the caster. The shadow mimics the caster’s actions
  (including speech) unless the caster concentrates on making
  the duplicate act differently. The caster can use the duplicate’s
  senses, and during the caster’s turn in a round, the caster can
  switch from seeing through its eyes to seeing normally, or back
  again. Any spell the caster casts originates from the shadow
  instead of from the caster. The caster must maintain a line of
  sight to the shadow at all times. If the caster’s line of sight is
  obstructed, the spell ends.

  This spell creates a magical barrier around the subject at
  a distance of 1 foot offering protection against one axis of
  alignment: evil, good, chaos, or law. Only one protection spell
  can be in effect at a time, even if each would protect against a
  different alignment. The barrier moves with the subject and
  grants a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws against creatures of
  the alignment chosen. The spell prevents bodily contact by all
  summoned or conjured creatures of any alignment: the melee
  attacks of such creatures fail and the creatures recoil from the
  protective magic. The protection against contact by summoned
  or conjured creatures ends if the warded creature makes an
  attack against, or tries to force the barrier against, the blocked
  creature. Spell resistance can allow a summoned or conjured
  creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded
  creature.
  <p>The spell can also block any attempt to possess the warded
creature or to exercise mental control over the creature by
creatures of any alignment. The protection does not prevent
casting a spell that gains mental control, but it prevents the
caster of such a spell from mentally commanding the protected
creature. If the protection ends before the mental control
does, the caster would then be able to mentally command
the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a
possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place
before the spell is cast.</p>

  Casting this spell transforms a fire into either a burst of blinding

  caster. The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of
  glowing and colored aerial lights. This effect blinds creatures
  within 100 feet of the fire source for 1d4 rounds (dexterity
  negates). Creatures must have line of sight to the fire in order to
  be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness. The smoke
  cloud is a writhing stream of choking smoke, billowing out from
  the source. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts
  for 1 round per caster level. All forms of natural sight including
  darkvision, deepvision, and twilight vision, are ineffective in or

  Quench extinguishes all nonmagical fires in a 50 foot x 50 foot
  area or one magic item. The spell also dispels fire-based spells
  in the area. In the latter case though, the caster must make an
intelligence check with a challenge level equal to that of the
level of the caster of the fire-based spell. Fire-based creatures
within the spell’s area take 1d4 points of damage per caster level.

<p>Alternatively, the caster can target the spell on a single magic
item that creates or controls flame. The item temporarily loses
all its fire-based magical abilities unless it succeeds at an item
saving throw. Artifacts are immune to this effect.</p>

  A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors

  With this spell, the caster brings a dead creature back to life but
  bound within another creature’s body, provided that the death
  occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell.
  The magic of the spell creates an entirely new, young adult body
  for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This
  process requires 1 hour to complete.
  <p>The reincarnated subject recalls most of their former life and
retains the intelligence, wisdom, charisma scores, and hit points
from their former existence. Strength, dexterity and constitution
scores depend on the new body. The attributes of animal forms
are typical for each particular species, but the player should roll
new physical attributes if reincarnated as a player character
race. The ability to speak is not guaranteed.</p>
  <p>The character retains his class, but it’s possible for the new form
to impede use of class abilities or even advancement in a class.
Moreover, the character’s level is reduced by 1; if the character
was 1st level, then the new form’s constitution is reduced by 1.
A reincarnation followed by a subsequent wish spell can restore a
reincarnated character to their original form.</p>

  This spell allows the caster to remove the effects of a curse from
  an object or creature. Remove curse does not remove the curse
  from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the
  spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed
  item to remove it and get rid of it. Certain special curses may
  not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a
caster of a certain level or higher.
<p>Bestow Curse: The reverse of this spell allows the caster to
place a curse on a creature. The caster can choose one of the
following effects: -6 to one ability score (which cannot reduce
the score below 1), or a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws
and checks. Subject to the Castle Keeper’s approval, the caster
may invent a new curse, but it must be no more powerful than
the standard curses.
</p>
<p>The Castle Keeper has final say on a curse’s effect. A curse
cannot be dispelled with dispel magic, but it can be nullified by
limited wish, remove curse, or wish spell.</p>

  chest’s actual size. To prepare the spell, the caster must have
  a chest created by master craftsmen from rare and expensive
  materials costing at least 5,000gp, as well as a perfect miniature
  replica of said chest, costing 50gp. Once the chests are complete,
  the caster invokes the spell – with the result that the larger
  chest and any contents are sent to the ethereal plane.

  <p>In the case of the illusionist, the chest is not sent to the ethereal
plane but is instead cloaked by a powerful magic that makes it
invisible to viewers and causes creatures to simply pass through
it or around it.</p>

<p>The caster uses the smaller chest to retrieve the larger chest at
will until the 60 days expiration. After 60 days, the chest begins
to deteriorate rapidly. There is a 5% cumulative chance per day
it will be forever lost. If the small chest is lost or destroyed, then
the larger chest and its contents will be irretrievable, absent a
wish. Any living creatures in the chest must eat, and will age
normally. Only one set of chests can be owned at a single time</p>

<p>It is important to note that powerful magic could allow someone
to discover the hidden chests either on the ethereal plane or
hidden from view.</p>

  The caster conjures a sturdy cottage or lodge, made of material
  common to the area that is level, clean and dry. The cottage is
  25 feet x 25 feet. In all respects it resembles a normal cottage,
  with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, a small fireplace
  and simple furniture consisting of eight bunk beds, a trestle
  table, eight stools and a writing desk as well as simple utensils
  and cooking implements. The shelter is as secure as a normal

  The caster causes the appearance, garb and equipment of
  one creature per two levels of caster experience to change
  to whatever the caster wishes, with the following limits. The
  recipients must maintain their basic forms (humanoid, horse,

  up to 50% lighter or heavier. The illusion provides the change
  in appearance, but not any change in demeanor, class abilities

  This spell allows for rapid travel along a shadow pathway. To
  cast this spell, the caster must be in an area of heavy shadows.
  The caster and any creature touched, up to 1 per level, are
  then transported along a swirling pathway of shadowstuff to
  the edge of normal reality, where it borders a plane of shadow.
  <p>The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. Travelers
on the shadow path move at a rate of up to seven miles every
10 minutes. Movement appears normal on the shadow path,
but is in reality rapid relative to the material plane. The caster
is innately aware of location relative to the material plane
and therefore will know exactly where the party will emerge.
Any creature unwilling to continue traveling with the caster
will either wander off into the plane of shadow, or return to a
random spot on the material plane (50% chance of each).</p>
<p>The spell may also be used to travel to other planes that border
the plane of shadow, but this requires the caster to actually
traverse the plane of shadow and face its perils. Such a journey
requires 1d4 hours to complete.</p>

  real, and grants the caster most of the abilities of the creature

  well as wisdom scores and hit points. Other attributes might
  change as a result of the new form. The character retains his
  or her extraordinary abilities, spells and spell-like abilities. The
  character can cast spells for which he or she has components.
  The character needs a humanlike voice for verbal components
  and humanlike hands for somatic components. The caster does
  not gain the spell-like or supernatural abilities of the new form,
  but does gain the extraordinary abilities of the new form.

creature not more than 200 feet in length. Even amorphous

  The caster creates a magical snare that is unlikely to be detected
  by anyone actively searching for it without magical means. Treat
  the snare as if it was set and hidden by a 12th level rogue. It
  can be created from a supple vine, rope, leather or any such
  similar material. Once enchanted, the snare blends into its
  environment and will wrap its loop around anything that steps
  within it. The snare can be up to 20 feet long.
  <p>If a supple tree is nearby, the snare will attach its other end
to the tree and bend it down, snapping it up again when the
snare is activated; this pulls the victim up into the air and
causes 1d6 damage. If a tree is not available, the loop will whip
around the victim, causing no damage but tightly binding it. A
snared creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and suffers a
-4 penalty to dexterity. To break free requires a strength check
against challenge level 5. The snare has 5 hit points and armor
class 7.</p>

  This spell summons wild animals to aid the caster. The animals
  appear wherever the caster designates within range, and act
  immediately on the caster’s turn in the initiative order thereafter.
  If the caster can communicate with the animals, the caster can
  direct them not to attack, to attack particular enemies or to
  perform other actions. If ordered to attack, animals do so to the
  best of their ability. Summoned creatures disappear at the end
  of the spell’s duration.
  <p>The spell conjures one or more animals with total HD equal
to the caster’s level. Thus, a 6th level caster can summon
one 6 HD animal, or six 1 HD animals. The caster chooses
the HD distribution desired, and the spell attempts to
accommodate the request. The caster does not choose the
specific type of animal summoned, although a request can
be worked into the spell’s casting. General requests, such
as animals that fly, clever animals or fierce animals are
more likely to be answered. The animals summoned will
come from the region where the spell is cast, and are always
determined by the Castle Keeper. A listing of some possible
animals include, but are not limited to, normal and giant
varieties of the following: ape, badger, bat, bear (black,
brown, grizzly, cave, polar), bison, boar, cat, cheetah,
crocodile, dog (wild), eagle, elephant, frog, hawk, horse
(wild), leopard, lion, lizard, manta ray, monkey, octopus,

  This spell calls a familiar, a unique companion and servant, and
  binds it to the caster. Doing so takes a day and uses up materials
  costing at least 100gp. A familiar is a magical, unusually tough
  and very intelligent version of a small animal or magical beast.
  The creature serves willingly. A character may have only one
  familiar at a time.
  <p>An empathic link forms between the master and familiars, granting
special abilities to the master as detailed below. The empathic link
functions only if the familiar is within one mile of its master.</p>
<p>Familiars do not involve themselves in combat. A familiar may
fight if its master faces a life-and-death situation, but magical
beast familiars, especially those of an evil alignment, might not
do so if the familiar feels its own life would be jeopardized. If
a familiar dies, or the master chooses to dismiss it, the master
loses a level in the class that allowed the spell to be cast
and permanently loses the number of hit points the familiar
granted the master. A master’s experience point total can
never go below zero as the result of a familiar’s demise. A slain
or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and a day.
Slain familiars can be raised from the dead just as characters
can be, but do not lose a level or a constitution point when
this occurs. If a familiar is raised from the dead, the caster will
recover the experience points and hit points lost as a result of
the familiar’s death.</p>


<p>The type of familiar that responds to the spell is randomly
determined, or, some say, is directed by the deities. The Castle
Keeper might apply modifiers to the roll to determine the
familiar, especially if more than the usual special materials are
used in casting the spell. Or, the Castle Keeper may allow the
character to choose if certain unusual circumstances are met
or are part of the story of the game. The caster may refuse to
accept the familiar that is summoned, but the caster will be
unable to successfully cast the spell again for one year and a day.
Some magical beast familiars serve only a master of a certain
alignment. If such a magical beast is summoned by the spell and
it refuses to serve the caster, the caster can attempt the spell
again after one month and a day has passed.</p>

Some sample stats for the various creatures are included as a
basis for the Castle Keeper to build upon.

<p> <b>CAT</b> <i>(These neutral animal vital stats are HD 2d2, AC14, move 30
feet.Their primary attributes are physical and mental (see below). Cats
threaten in combat but the damage of their attack is negligible. See the
chart above for special abilities.)</i> </p>

<p> <b>HAWK</b><i>(These neutral animal vital stats are HD 2d6, AC 14, move 5
feet or 120 feet in flight. Their primary attributes are physical and mental
(see below). They attack with their talons for one point of damage or
beak for 1d2. See the chart above for special abilities.)</i> </p>


<p> <b>OWL</b><i>(These neutral animal vital stats are HD 2d6, AC 14, move 5
feet or 60 feet in flight. Their primary attributes are physical and mental
(see below). They attack with their talons for one point of damage or
beak for 1d2. See the chart above for special abilities.)</i> </p>


<p> <b>RAVEN</b><i>(These normal animal vital stats are HD 2d2, AC 14, move
5 feet or 60 feet in flight. Their primary attributes are physical and
mental (see below). They do not participate in combat and flee when
danger threatens. See the chart above for special abilities.)</i> </p>

<p> <b>TOAD</b><i>(These small amphibian vital stats are HD 2d8, AC 16, move
10 feet or 20 foot jump. Their primary attributes are physical and mental
(see below). They prefer to hide and use their natural coloration for
camouflage. Contact with their skin necessitates a constitution save
against a type I-IV poison (CK determines). See the chart above for
special abilities.)</i> </p>

<p> <b>WEASEL</b><i>(These small rodent vital stats are HD 2d4,
AC13, move 30 feet or climb 20 feet. Their primary
attributes are physical and mental (see below). Weasels
avoid combat. Their stealthy abilities (see chart above) make
them ideal scouts.)</i> </p>

<p> FAMILIAR BASICS </p>
<p> Use the basic statistics for a creature of its type, as appearing in
Monsters & Treasures, except for the following changes:
Hit Dice: Double the hit dice for a normal animal of the type.
Hit Points: The familiar’s hit point total is added to the
master’s own hit points, as long as the familiar is within one mile.
Saving Throws: The familiar uses the master’s base saving
throw bonuses if they’re better than the familiar’s bonuses.
Intelligence: Animal familiars are unusually intelligent,
and will have an effective intelligence of 1d4+8 (9-12). Magical
beast familiars have an effective intelligence of 1d4+10 (11-
14), unless a typical creature of its type has a higher intelligence.
Special Abilities: Each familiar has its own special abilities,
or enhanced senses, as noted in the table. In addition, the
familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the
same type as itself, and the communication is limited by the
intelligence of the conversing creatures.
Empathic Link: The empathic link allows the master to
communicate telepathically with the familiar for up to one mile.
Although some familiars may be able to communicate verbally
with their master, telepathic communication is typically better
in conveying meaning and intent.
Additionally, the empathic link allows the master to share the
familiar’s senses as long as the master concentrates on doing so
(just like spell concentration). When concentrating, the master
shares the familiar’s five senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste,
and touch). Thus, for example, the master can see through the
familiar’s eyes. If a familiar has an enhanced sense, like superior
hearing, the master gains the benefit of the enhanced sense as
well, but only as to what the familiar can sense. In other words,
an owl familiar does not grant its master the special ability of
superior hearing, the master simply shares and listens through
the owl when concentrating on doing so. Sharing the familiar’s
senses is a somewhat alien process, as a familiar
does not always sense in the same way a
person does. Some familiars may have a
deficiency in one sense, or lack certain
body parts, such as ears, that are normally
associated with a sense.
The empathic link also allows the
master to cast a spell on a familiar that
normally can only be cast on the caster
alone, without having to touch the
familiar (range is up to one mile). At
the master’s option, the master may
cast any spell on himself and it will
also affect a familiar (such as shield).
If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous,
the spell stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther
than one mile away. The spell’s effect will not be restored
even if the familiar returns to the master before the duration would
otherwise have ended. The master and familiar can share spells in
this way, even if the spells normally would not affect creatures of
the familiar’s type.</p>



<p> <b>CELESTIAL AND FIENDISH ANIMALS:</b></p>
<p>A celestial (good
or holy) or fiendish (evil or unholy) version of an animal. The
Castle Keeper should pick a type on the summoned familiar
table, or roll again on it to determine the type of celestial animal.
A celestial familiar serves only good-aligned characters, and a
fiendish familiar serves only evil-aligned characters. A celestial
or fiendish animal shares its spell resistance with its master as
long as the master is within 150 ft.</p>

<p> <b>MAGICAL BEAST</b></p>

<p>Magical beast familiars are more independent than a normal
familiar. Each has its own unique special abilities. The master
does not gain the special abilities of a magical beast unless
otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>Demon: A small demon such as a quasit, or other demon of
the Castle Keeper’s creation. A demon familiar is one of the most
independent types, and it will only serve a chaotic evil or chaotic
neutral master. A demon’s special abilities are determined by
the Castle Keeper or are indicated in the demon’s entry in Tome
of the Unclean or Monsters & Treasure of Aihrde. They do not
share their unique special abilities with their master, and are
highly unlikely to fight to save their master’s life.</p>
<p>QUASIT (These minor demon vital stats are HD 2d8, AC 14, move
40 feet or fly 60 feet. Their primary attributes are physical. They attack
with either their claws (1d2) or bite (1d2). They are able to cast the
following spells once per day at the 3rd level of ability; protection from
good, darkness and pyrotechnics.)</p>
<p>Devil: A small devil such as an imp or other devil of the Castle
Keeper’s creation. A devil familiar is more independent than
normal, for its lawful nature creates loyalty. A devil familiar will
only serve a lawful evil or neutral evil master. A devil’s special
abilities are determined by the Castle Keeper or are indicated in
the devil’s entry for them in Tome of the Unclean or Monsters
& Treasure of Aihrde. They do not share their unique special
abilities with their master, and are highly unlikely to fight to
save their master’s life.</p>
<p>IMP (These minor devil vital stats are HD 2d8, AC 15, move 20 feet
or fly 60 feet. Their primary attributes are physical. They attack with
either their bite (1d4) or stinger which causes one point of damage.
The stinger administers poison and if a constitution check is not made,
the victim suffers 2 points per round for 4 rounds. Imps regenerate one
point per round.)</p>
<p>Faerie: A small sprite such as a pixie, brownie or any other
such creature of myth, or one of the Castle Keeper’s creation.
Faerie familiars have all the qualities of the fey, and they can be
independent but loyal, annoying but playful. A faerie familiar
will serve a master of any alignment, if reasonable for a creature
of its type, but most prefer chaotic good, chaotic neutral, neutral
good, neutral or neutral evil masters. Most of their special
abilities cannot be shared with the master, but those with spell
resistance will normally share it with their master.</p>
<p>PIXIE (Their vital stats are HD 2d4 AC 15, move 20 feet or fly
60 feet. Their primary attributes are physical. They attack with small
arrows which do 2-5 points of damage, or another variety that causes
sleep for 1d6 minutes, or yet another which causes memory loss, unless
an intelligence save is made. All arrows have a +4 effective bonus to
attack rolls.)</p>
<p>Familiar Dragon: A familiar dragon is a very small dragon
about 2 to 3 feet in length. Some look like a miniature version
of a larger, true dragon, while others have no true draconic
counterpart. Their special abilities may mimic a true dragon’s,
or may more resemble those of a pseudodragon’s. Each familiar
dragon is unique; and the CK determines its details and special
abilities, and which of those abilities are shared with the master
(if any). They are extremely loyal. A familiar dragon responding
to the summons will always be the same alignment as the caster.</p>

aberrations, animals (including giant varieties), beasts, dragons,
fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids,
oozes, outsiders, plants, shapechangers and vermin.
<p>The caster cannot choose the specific type of monster summoned,

  This spell is like summon animals and summon beasts, except
  it summons either magical beasts or fey. The spell conjures
  one or more magical beasts or fey with total HD equal to the
  caster’s level. Thus, a 14th level caster can summon one 14

  This spell is much like summon lesser monster, but the monsters
  are considerably more powerful. The spell conjures one or
  more monsters with total HD equal to the caster’s level, but
  no monster can have more than 6 HD. Thus, a 12th level caster
  can summon two 6 HD monsters, or two 5 HD monsters plus
  one 2 HD monster. For purposes of this spell, monsters include
  only aberrations, animals (including giant varieties), beasts,
  fey, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes,
  outsiders, plants, shapechangers and vermin.
  <p>The caster does not choose the specific type of monster
summoned, although a request can be worked into the spell’s
casting. More general requests, such as monsters that fly, magical
monsters or fierce monsters are more likely to be answered. The
summoned monsters come from the region where the spell is
cast, and are always determined by the Castle Keeper.</p>

  Beseeching their deity, the caster pleads for aid, prompting
  the deity to select and send assistance in the form of
  a number of appropriate elementals or extraplanar
  creatures totaling no more than 16 HD. The caster
  may request a known individual creature beholden
  to the deity, but the deity can ignore this request
  and send a different creature. If the character
  serves no particular deity, the spell is a general
  plea answered by a creature sharing
  the character’s philosophical
  alignment.

<p>The caster may ask the summoned
creature or creatures to perform one
task, and a summoned creature may request some
service in return (as befits the creature’s outlook,
alignment, deity and the magnitude of favor
asked). If the caster agrees to these requests, the
creature performs the task asked of them,
reporting back to the character afterward
if possible, then returning to their home
plane. The caster is honor-bound to
perform the return favor, and may lose
any or all clerical abilities if they fail to
do so. This will last until such a point as
the caster properly atones, in whatever
manner their deity sees fit, for the
breech of promise. A creature might
accept some form of payment, such
as a magic item, in return for its accesskey
service. The creature might keep it or may deliver the item
to another member of the character’s religion somewhere else
where the item can help the religion’s cause.</p>

  The caster summons a 5 by 5 foot swarm of insects to attack

  Keeper. The swarm will not extend beyond the range of the spell.
  A creature caught in the swarm who takes no action other than
  fighting off the swarming creatures takes 1 point of damage per
  round. Any other action attempted, even if it is simply leaving
  the swarm, results in 1d4 plus +1 HP per caster level of damage

  per round. Weapons do not effect a swarm, but fire and area effect
  attacks can cause it to disperse. The swarm will disperse when it

<p style="margin-left: 3px; margin-top: 3px;">
  <p>This spell allows the caster to scribe, either
  in the air or on a surface, a variety of mystic
  sigils and runes. The effects depend on the
  caster’s choice of symbols, but some
  common symbols are described below.
  The Castle Keeper is free to add to
  this list. The material components
  for this spell are a diamond tipped
  pen and ink made from some
  unusual creature. The total
  value of these items should
  cost no less than 5000gp.</p>

  <p>All symbols are inactive after being traced, and are programmed
  to activate on a circumstance given to it by the caster. As a
  guidance, most symbols are triggered whenever a creature does
  one or more of the following, as the caster selects: reads, touches
  or passes over the rune; looks at the rune; or passes through a
  portal bearing the rune.</p>

  <p>In this case, reading the rune means any attempt to study it,
  identify it or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a
  symbol to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To
  trigger a symbol, a creature must be within 30 feet of the rune.
  The caster can also create a command word that can be spoken
  prior to any of the above actions, so that the symbol will not
  activate. Creatures who subsequently meet an active symbol’s
  triggering conditions suffer its effects.</p>

<p> <b>Death:</b>  One or more creatures within 30 feet whose combined
  total hit points do not exceed 100 must succeed at a
  constitution check or die. The symbol affects the closest
  creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to
  affect. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.
  Once triggered, the symbol lasts until it has affected 100 hit
  points worth of creatures.</p>
<p> <b>Discord:</b> All creatures with an intelligence score of 3 or higher
within 30 feet who fail an intelligence save immediately fall
into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication
is impossible. If the affected creatures have different
alignments, there is a 50% chance that they will attack each
other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds
into the bickering, and lasts 2d4 rounds. This symbol must be
carefully engraved on a surface. Once triggered, the symbol
lasts 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
<p>   <b>Fear:</b> Living creatures within 30 feet become panicked unless
  they save versus charisma at -4. Those that fail suffer a -2
  penalty on charisma saving throws for 10 minutes per caster
  level, and they flee from the area. A panicked creature has
  a 50% chance to drop what it’s holding, chooses its path
  randomly (as long as it is getting away from immediate danger)
  and flees any other dangers that confront it. If cornered, a
  panicked creature cowers. Once triggered, the symbol lasts
  10 minutes per level.</p>
<p> <b>Hopelessness:</b> All creatures within 30 feet radius must
attempt charisma saves at a -4 penalty. If the save fails, the
creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4x10 minutes and
submits to simple demands from foes, such as to surrender
or get out. If no foes are present to make demands, there is
a 25% chance that a hopeless creature proves unable to take
any action except hold its ground. If the creature remains free
to act, there is a 25% chance it will retreat from the rune at
normal speed. In either case, the creature can defend itself
normally if attacked. Once triggered, the symbol lasts 10
minutes per caster level.</p>
<p> <b>Insanity:</b> One or more creatures within 30 feet, whose
combined total hit points do not exceed 150, become insane
unless they make an intelligence saving throw. Insane creatures
behave randomly, either wandering away for 1 minute (unless
prevented), doing nothing for 1 round, attacking the nearest
creature for 1 round, or acting normally for 1 round until the
spell ends. The spell lasts until a restoration, greater restoration,
heal, limited wish or wish is cast on the creature. The symbol
affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too
many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol lasts
until it has affected 150 hit points worth of creatures.</p>
<p> <b>Pain:</b> Creatures within 30 feet suffer wracking pains that
temporarily reduce dexterity scores by 2 and impose a -4
penalty on attack rolls, dexterity saves and ability checks. A
successful constitution save at -4 negates these effects. The
pain lasts 2d10x10 minutes. Once triggered, the symbol lasts
10 minutes per caster level.</p>
<p> <b>Persuasion:</b> All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a
charisma save at -4 to resist. If the save fails, the creature
becomes the same alignment as the caster for 1d20 x 10
minutes. During this time, affected creatures become friendly
to the caster. The spell does not enable the character to
control the creatures as if they were automatons, but the
creatures perceive the character’s words and actions in the
most favorable way. The caster can try to give the creatures
orders, but must succeed at a charisma check (difficulty
determined by the Castle Keeper) to convince the creatures
to do anything they wouldn’t ordinarily do. The creatures
never obey suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by
the character or the character’s apparent allies that threatens
the creatures breaks the spell. Note also that the caster must
speak the creatures’ language to communicate the character’s
commands, or else be good at pantomiming.</p>
<p> <b>Sleep:</b> Creatures within 30 feet fall into a catatonic slumber if
they have 8 or fewer HD (intelligence save negates). Sleeping
creatures cannot be awakened for 3d6x10 minutes. Once
triggered, the symbol lasts 10 minutes per caster level.
Stunning: One or more creatures within 30 feet whose total hit
points do not exceed 200 must succeed at a constitution save
or become stunned. The symbol affects the closest creatures
first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.
A stunned creature can’t act, and loses any dexterity bonus
to AC. Attackers gain a+2 bonus while attacking stunned
creatures. In addition, stunned creatures will drop what they
are holding.</p>

  By concentrating, the caster can move an object or creature
  weighing 25 pounds per level of the caster up to 20 feet
  per round by mental command. A creature can negate the
  effect against itself with a successful charisma save at -4,
and against an object it possesses with a successful strength
save, or with SR.
<p>The spell lasts up to 1 round per caster level, but it ends if the
caster ceases concentrating. The weight can be moved in any
direction, but not beyond the spell’s range. The spell ends if an
object is forced beyond the range.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the caster chooses, the spell energy can be
expended in a single round. The caster can hurl, with massive
force, one object or creature (within range toward any target
also within range). The caster can hurl up to a total weight
of 25 pounds per caster level. To hit a target with a hurled
item, caster must succeed at an attack roll using the caster’s
to hit bonus + the caster’s intelligence modifier. Weapons
hurled by the spell cause double standard damage (with no
strength bonus). Other objects cause 1d6 points of damage
per 25 pounds of weight. Creatures who fall within the weight
capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed a
charisma save as noted above. If a creature is hurled against a
solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 30 feet.</p>

  This spell instantly transports the caster, and a certain
  amount of additional weight, to any designated destination
  on the same plane of existence. The caster can transport
  his body and gear, willing creatures, and objects not held by
  other creatures. All of these items can total no more than
  50 pounds per caster level. The character must have some
  clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The
  clearer the character’s mental image, the more likely the
  teleportation works (see table). Areas of strong physical or
  magical energies may make teleportation more hazardous or
  even impossible.
  <p>Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the astral plane;
anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.

<p> <b>Very Familiar: </b>A place where the caster has been very
often and feels at home.</p>
<p> <b>Studied Carefully:</b> A place the caster knows well, either
because they have been there often or have used other means
to study the place.</p>
<p> <b>Seen Casually: </b>A place that the caster has seen more than
once, but with which the character is not very familiar.</p>
<p> <b>Viewed Once: </b>A place that the caster has seen once.</p>
<p> <b>Description: </b>A place whose location and appearance
the caster knows only through someone else’s description,
perhaps even from a precise map.</p>
<p> <b>False Destination: </b>A place that does not exist. When
traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results
on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real
destination for the character to hope to arrive at, or even be
off target from.</p>
<p> <b>On Target: </b>The caster appears at the desired location.</p>
<p>Off Target: The character appears safely a random distance
away from the destination in a random direction. Distance
off target is 1d10 x 1d10% of the distance that was to be
traveled. The Castle Keeper determines the direction off
target randomly.</p>
<p> <b>Similar Area: </b>The caster winds up in an area that’s visually
or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, the caster
appears in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no
range limit, they could conceivably wind up somewhere else
across the globe.</p>
<p> <b>Mishap: </b>The caster and those teleporting with the caster
suffer one of the following: 1-3 scrambled; 4-5 appear above;
6 appear below the intended destination. Scrambled travelers
each take 1d10 points of damage, and the CK re-rolls on the
chart to see where the travelers wind up. For these re-rolls,
roll 1d20+80 and each time mishap comes up, the characters
take more damage and must re roll. Characters appearing
above do so 1d6x10 feet above the intended destination and
suffer appropriate damage if they fall. Characters appearing
below do so 1d6x10 feet below the intended destination and
either instantly die from teleporting into a solid surface or
appear in whatever open space exists underground.</p>

  By casting this spell, the caster creates a 10-foot diameter circle
  on any horizontal surface that teleports any creature on it to a
  designated location. Once the caster chooses the destination, it
  cannot be changed. The spell fails if the caster attempts to set
  the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with
  which the caster is not familiar and has no clear description
  or to another plane. The circle itself is nearly impossible to
  notice. If the caster intends to keep creatures from activating
  it accidentally, the circle must be marked in some way.

  The caster places the target into a state of suspended animation.
  For the creature, time ceases to flow and it does not grow older.
  Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can
  harm it. The onset of poisons and disease and bleeding from
  mortal wounds ceases. This state persists until the magic is
  removed by a successful dispel magic, or until the caster releases
  the spell. The caster can release the spell at any time, with a

  This spell causes time to cease flowing for everyone but the
  caster. The caster is free to act in any manner for the spell’s
  duration, including attacking, casting spells or manipulating
  objects. All other creatures are frozen in place, unable to act.
  Creatures with SR can resist the effect. Energy and effects
  present in the area can still affect the caster. The caster cannot
  enter an area protected by an anti-magic field, or by protection
  from alignment, or by a magic circle spell, while under the effects of
  time stop. Spells cast or damage inflicted by the caster on another
  target during a time stop has no effect until the time stop ends.
  At that time, targets of spells receive a saving throw to avoid or
  mitigate effects if one is normally allowed. Physical damage, by
  weapon or spell, also accrues after the time stop ends. Spells cast
upon the caster during a time stop take effect immediately upon
casting. Durations of spells cast in this way should include the
time spent in effect during the time stop. For example, a wizard
casts shield during the first round of a time stop; the duration
of his shield should include the one remaining round of the time
stop for the purpose of determining when the spell dissipates.

  The caster creates an unmoving, opaque sphere of force around
  his or her self. A small opaque glass ball is fixed in place, and
  does not move with the caster. The sphere can be of any color.
  Half of the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower
  hemisphere passes through the ground. Up to nine other humansize
  or smaller creatures can fit into the field with the caster and
  they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming
  it. However, if the caster leaves the hut, the spell ends. The
  temperature inside the hut is 70˚ F if the exterior temperature
  is between 0˚ and 100˚ F. An exterior temperature below 0
  degrees or above 100 degrees lowers or raises, respectively, the
  interior temperature on a degree for degree basis (thus, if it’s
  -20 degrees outside, inside it’ll be 50 degrees). The hut also
  provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust and
  sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane
  force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force
  destroys it. The caster can dimly illuminate the interior upon
  command or extinguish the light as desired. Note that although
  the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from
  within. Missiles, weapons and most spell effects can pass through
  the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be
  seen from outside the hut, and thus have total concealment.

  This spell can transform normal mud or quicksand of any depth
  into soft stone permanently. Creatures in the mud are allowed
  a dexterity save to escape before the area is hardened to stone.
  Alternatively, the spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock
  of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical or enchanted
  stone is not affected. The depth of the mud created cannot
  exceed 10 feet. Creatures unable to levitate, fly or otherwise
  free themselves from the mud will sink and potentially
  asphyxiate. If the spell is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or
  tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a
  depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal
  8d6 points of damage to anyone caught directly beneath the
  area, or half damage to those who succeed at dexterity saves.
  Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the
  effects of the spell because the spell can’t affect worked stone
  and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’
  foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest
  upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even
  partially toppled by this spell. Each substance changed remains
  thus unless natural forces such as evaporation or magical forces
  restore its state but not necessarily its form. Each version of this
  spell dispels the other, but again, does not restore the original
  form. The spell can effect two 20 foot cubes per level.

  This spell forces, or convinces, a creature’s material body and
  life force to enter into an extra-dimensional space within a gem,
  worth at least 1000gp per level or HD of the creature trapped.
  The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem
  is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material
  body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature
  from another plane, it can be required to perform a service
  immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go
  free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. The spell can be
  triggered in one of two ways.
  <p> <b>Spell Completion: </b>The spell can be completed by speaking
  its final word as if the caster were casting a regular spell at the
  subject. This allows SR (if any) and an intelligence save to
  avoid the effect. If the creature’s true name is spoken as well,
  any SR is ignored but the save CL increases by 2. If the save
  or SR is successful, the gem shatters.</p>
  <p> <b>Trigger Object:</b> The second method tricks the subject into
  accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word,
  automatically placing the creature’s soul in the trap. To use
  this method, both the creature’s true name and the trigger
  word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem
  is enchanted. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the
  trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the
  gem without the benefit of SR or a save.</p>

  Vision quickly brings to the caster’s mind legends about an important
  person, place or thing, but produces some strain on the caster. The
  caster poses a question about some person, place or object, then
casts the spell and goes to sleep. If the person or object is at hand,
or if the character is in the place in question, the caster receives a
vision about it with a successful intelligence check.

<p>If the person, place or object is not at hand, but detailed
information is known by the caster, the intelligence check
is made at -5, and any information gained is incomplete.
Incomplete information often provides enough clues to help the
caster find the person, place or thing. This allows for a better
vision when the spell is next cast. If only rumors are known, the
intelligence check is made at -10, and any information gained
is vague (though it often directs the caster to more detailed
information, thus allowing a better vision).</p>

<p>When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about
the person, place or thing to the caster’s mind. These may be
legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten
or even information that has never been generally known. If the
person, place or thing is not of legendary importance, the caster
gains no information.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, characters 10th level and higher are
legendary, as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the
major magic items they wield and the places where they perform
their key deeds.</p>

  fiery wall or curtain of fire measures up to 20 feet long per
  caster level (up to 100 ft long at 10th level). The ring of fire
  measures up to 10 feet wide per every two caster levels (up to
  50 feet diameter at 10th level).

<p>One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of
heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10
feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those between 10 and 20
feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and for each
round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition,
the wall deals 2d6+1 point per caster level of fire damage to any
creature entering or passing through the wall. The wall deals
double damage to undead creatures. No saving throw is allowed
for any of the heat or fire damage.</p>

<p>If the caster evokes the wall so that it appears where creatures are
already present, each creature takes damage as if passing through
the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall by making a
successful dexterity save. (If the creature ends up on the hot side
of the wall, it takes 2d4 points of damage, as normal.)</p>

<p>The caster may maintain the wall indefinitely by concentrating
on doing so, or may forgo continued concentration, in which
case the wall will last 1 round per caster level.</p>


<p>The wall can be attacked and cancelled by cold spells and
damage. If any 5 foot length of the wall takes 20 points of cold
damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out.</p>

  Similar to wall of fire, this spell creates an anchored sheet or
  hemisphere of ice. Unlike wall of fire, a wall of ice cannot form
  in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface
  must be smooth and unbroken when created. Fire can melt a
  wall of ice. Suddenly melting the wall of ice creates a great cloud
  of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes. There are two versions
  of the spell available:

<p> <b>Sheet of ice:</b>  A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The
wall may be created either vertically or horizontally/slanting.
Vertical walls anchor themselves to the floor, while a horizontal
or slanting wall must have two opposite surfaces to anchor
itself. The sheet has two possible measurements: (1) up to 10
feet per caster level long, 1 inch per caster level thick, and 10
feet tall/wide, or (2) up to 5 feet per caster level long, 1 inch per
caster level thick, and 20 feet tall/wide. A horizontal sheet of ice
created in the air without two anchor points acts as a sleet storm
spell, but lasts only 5 rounds and covers an area equaling one of
the two possible measurements.</p>
<p>Each 10-foot length (for the former) or 5-foot length (for
the latter) has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures
can hit the wall automatically, and a section of wall whose
hit points drop to 0 is breached. Even when the ice has been
broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains that deals 1d6
+1 point per caster level of cold damage to any creature
stepping through it. Fire-using creatures passing through
this cold air suffer double damage, while cold-using creatures
suffer no damage.</p>

<p> <b>Hemisphere of Ice:</b>  The wall takes the form of a hemisphere
of ice over the caster or a designated target. The hemisphere has
a maximum possible diameter of 2 feet per caster level. It is as
hard to break through as the sheet of ice, but it does not deal
damage to those who go through a breach. The caster can create
the hemisphere so that it traps one or more creatures, though
these creatures can avoid being trapped by making successful
dexterity saves. </p>

  This spell creates a wall of rock that merges with and fuses
  into adjoining rock surfaces. To enact this spell requires a piece
  of stone from a wall. The wall is 1 inch thick per four caster
  levels, and up to 5 feet by 5 feet per caster level. The caster can
  double the wall’s area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot
  be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
  another object.
  <p>The caster can create the wall in almost any shape. The wall
need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation;
however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by
existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance,
or to form a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet,
the wall must be arched and buttressed or risk collapsing. This
requirement reduces the spell’s area by half. The wall can be
crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements and so forth
by likewise reducing the area. The Castle Keeper must make
final judgement on the amount of area consumed by any oddly
shaped construction.</p>

<p>Each 5 foot square area of the wall has 15 hit points per inch
of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically, but the
wall is so hard that the first 8 points of damage from each blow
are ignored. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is
breached. It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents
within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so
it can hold the creatures. Creatures avoid entrapment with
successful dexterity saves.</p>

  This spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable and tangled
  brush, bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a person’s finger
  that is 10 cubic feet in size per level of the caster. A simple
  thorn is used to enact this spell. Any creature forced into or
  attempting to move through the wall of thorns takes 25 points
  of damage per round of movement minus 1 point for each point
  of the creature’s AC that is granted by armor. Dexterity bonus
  to AC does not count for this calculation.
  <p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by
making a successful challenge level 10 Strength check
A successful creature moves a number of feet equal to its
strength divided by 3 (round down). Of course, moving or
attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as
described above.</p>
<p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes
damage as if it had moved into the wall, and is caught inside. In
order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can
wait until the spell ends. A creature trapped in the thorns can
choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more
damage. Creatures with the ability to pass unhindered through
overgrown areas can pass through a wall of thorns at normal
speed without taking damage.</p>
<p>A wall of thorns can be carefully breached by slow work with
edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage
1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot
harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.</p>

  A 10 x 20 foot high invisible vertical curtain of wind appears.

  Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose
  materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind

  other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall suffers
  a -6 to hit and -2 to damage. Massive ranged weapons like
  catapult boulders, are not affected. Gases, most gaseous breath

  This spell creates a many-layered 20 x 20 x 10 foot thick mass of
  strong, sticky strands resembling a giant spider’s web, that trap
  objects and creatures caught in them. A strand or wad of web
  from a spider’s web is used to enact this spell. The webs must be
  anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points
  or else it collapses upon itself. Creatures caught within a web or
  simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey
  fibers. Anyone in the spell’s area of effect when it is cast must
  make a dexterity save or become stuck. An entangled creature
  suffers a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls, a -4 penalty to
  effective dexterity and can’t move. An entangled character
  cannot cast spells with somatic components. A stuck creature
  can break loose by succeeding at a strength check.
  <p>Once loose (either by making the initial dexterity save or a later
strength check), a creature may progress through the web very
slowly at a rate of 5 feet per round. Each 5 feet of movement
requires a new strength check to avoid becoming stuck again.
The webs are flammable and fire burns 5 square feet in 1 round. All
creatures in the webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames.</p>

  This spell acts like phatasmal killer, but it affects all creatures
  within a 25 x 25 foot area. The caster causes a manifestation, in
  the targets’ minds, of the most horrific creature imaginable. This
  creature is the formulation of all the subconscious fears of each
  target, brought into a very convincing and deadly illusion. Only
  the caster and the targets can see the killers. The killers make
  illusory attacks upon the targets, who must make a successful
  intelligence saving throw or instantly die from fear and psychic
  damage. A successful saving throw results in 8d6 damage and
  stuns the targets for 1 round. The killers cannot be damaged,
  and will pass through all physical barriers to reach the targets.
  The killers cannot pass through any area of anti-magic.
  <p>If the illusionist casting the spell is killed before the effect
reaches the targets, the spell ends. In rare circumstances, such
as when a target makes a successful saving throw and is wearing
a helm of telepathy, the target can turn the killer back upon the
caster just as if the target cast the spell in the first place.</p>

  This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that is
  10 feet wide at the base, 30 feet tall and 30 feet wide at
  the top that moves through the air, along the ground or

  concentrate on controlling the cyclone’s every movement or
  specify a simple course of motion (that cannot be changed
  once set). The whirlwind moves during the caster’s turn in
  the initiative order. If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range,
  it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds

  it dissipates. Even if the cyclone moves back to within range

depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens

  The caster’s body becomes a cloud-like vapor, allowing movement
  through the air at great speed. The caster can also use the spell
  to affect additional creatures, each of which acts independently.
  The caster can add one creature per 3 levels of experience. A
  magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per
  round, or as slow as 5 feet per round. Wind walkers are not
  invisible, but appear misty and translucent. A wind walker can
  regain physical form as desired, and later resume the cloud form
  as long as the spell remains in effect. Each such change requires
  5 rounds. While in vaporous form, subjects gain immunity from
  physical harm, though they, at the Castle Keepers discretion,
  may sustain damage from high winds. No spell casting is possible
  in vaporous form. For the last minute of the spell, a wind walker
  automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600
  feet) unless the wind walker concentrates otherwise, although
  descent may be faster if desired. This descent serves as a warning
  that the spell is about to end.

  By speaking aloud, the caster alters reality with this most
powerful of spells. Even wishes, however, have limits. The
caster may wish for anything conceivable, but the wish must
be precisely stated. The longer and more complicated the
wish, the more dangerous the spell becomes. A wish gives
the opportunity to fulfill the caster’s request, but the spell,
for whatever reason, may pervert the caster’s intent into a
literal but undesirable fulfillment or a fulfillment with unseen
consequence. A wish never restores a level or constitution
loss from being raised, resurrected or reincarnated from
the dead. The caster of a wish spell always ages due to the
debilitating effects of the spell upon the body. The caster
must make a constitution save (challenge level 9) or age 3
years. Success means the caster ages only 1 year. Typically,
a wish can aid one creature but, multiple subjects can be
affected if, for example, they are all cured of the same type of
affliction. In such a case, the caster can affect one subject for
every three caster levels.
<p>Generally, a wish can do any one of the following, if worded
correctly, with little danger of misfortune: (1) Duplicate a
spell of 9th level or lower that the character knows and has
cast, or duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower that the
character has seen; (2) Undo the harmful effects of other
spells; (3) Create a valuable item, even a magic item, of up
to 15,000 gp in value; (4) Permanently raise or lower an
attribute by +1 or -1; (5) Remove injuries and afflictions; (6)
A wish can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating
resurrection; (7) A wish can revive a dead creature whose
body has been destroyed, but the feat takes two wishes, one
to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life
again. (8) A wish can lift one creature per caster level from
anywhere on any plane and place these creatures anywhere
else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling
target gets a Cha save to negate as well as SR; (9) A wish
can undo a single recent event. The wish forces a re roll of
any roll made within the last round. Reality reshapes itself to
accommodate the new result. The re roll, however, may be as
bad as or worse than the original roll.</p>

<p>Duplicated spells allow saves and SR as normal. When a wish
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more
than 10,000gp, the character must provide that component.</p>

  This spell teleports the caster instantly to the caster’s sanctuary
  when a command word is uttered. The caster must designate
  the sanctuary when the spell is prepared and it must be a very
  familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area
  no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. The caster can be transported
  any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes.
  The caster can transport, in addition to himself, objects and
  creatures weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level. Exceeding
  this limit causes the spell to fail. An unwilling creature can’t
  be teleported by word of recall. Unattended, nonmagical objects
  receive no saving throw.
