<h5 id="rogue_special">SPECIAL</h5>

Rogues favor light armor, as it allows them to better
ply their stealth abilities. Rogues may wear leather armor, a
leather coat, or padded armor, and can employ small shields
without any penalty to the use of their abilities. They may
also wear leather helmets. A rogue may wear any other type
of armor, but the character may suffer a penalty when using
class abilities and wearing these armors as noted in the ability
description. The penalty is equal to -1 for each point above
armor class 12 that the armor confers. Restricted helmets and
shields cause the rogue to suffer a -1 penalty to all abilities. All
penalties are cumulative.

<h5 id="rogue_back_attack">BACK ATTACK</h5>
A rogue normally avoids face-to-face
combat if possible, preferring instead to use stealth to catch
an opponent unaware. A rogue able to attack an opponent
from the rear, who is unaware of the rogue’s presence, gains a
bonus to hit and to damage. To catch an opponent unaware,
a rogue must make a successful move silently check to sneak
up behind the foe, or make a successful hide check while
behind the opponent. A rogue that succeeds in one or the
other of these can make a back attack at a +4 bonus to hit. A
successful hit inflicts double the normal damage.
<p>When making a back attack, a rogue must use a close-quarters
melee weapon. This weapon must be shorter than the character’s
arm. A rogue can only use this attack on creatures with a
discernible back. The rogue must be able to see the target well
enough to pick out a vital spot, and then must be able to reach it.</p>
<p>As the rogue gains experience, the damage inflicted increases.
At 5th level, a back attack deals triple damage, and at 9th level a
back attack inflicts quadruple damage. A back attack cannot be
combined with the sneak attack ability.</p>
<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_cant">CANT</h5>
Rogues often use a street language known only to those
in the trade, called cant. Code words, hand signals, demeanor,
and other signs comprise the cant. The cant can be used to
convey complex ideas. The language may vary to some degree
both geographically and culturally, making cants unique to each
region, city, or even within a city.
<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_climb">CLIMB (DEXTERITY)</h5>

This extraordinary ability allows a
rogue to climb up, down, or across a slope, wall, steep incline
(even a ceiling with hand holds), or unusually angled natural
or man made slope or incline that others would find impossible
to climb. When doing so, the rogue moves at one-half the
character’s normal speed. A failed climb check means that the
character makes no progress. A check that fails by 5 or more
means that the character falls from the currently attained height,
and must suffer falling damage. Rogues can not carry anything in
their hands while climbing. When climbing typical natural slopes
and man made inclines, such as a cliff faces or steep steps, a rogue
does not need to make an attribute check to climb the surface.

<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_decipher_script">DECIPHER SCRIPT (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
This ability allows
a rogue to decipher writing in an unfamiliar language, a
message written in an incomplete or archaic form or a
message written in code. If the check succeeds, the character
understands the general content of a piece of writing. It takes
2d8 minutes to decipher each page of a script. The attempt
may be made only once per writing.
<p>A rogue may use this ability to decipher arcane script if a
successful check is made at a penalty of -10. If successful he
can read the spell but not cast the spell. This ability may not be
used to decipher divine scrolls.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_hide">HIDE (DEXTERITY)</h5>
Rogues use this ability to conceal
themselves from others. A successful check means that the
rogue is hidden so well as to be almost invisible. The rogue can
move up to one-half normal speed and remain hidden. Hide
checks suffer no penalty in this circumstance. At more than
one-half and up to full speed, the character suffers a -5 penalty
to the check to remain hidden. It’s practically impossible (-20
penalty) to hide while running or charging.

<p>If the character is being observed, even casually, they cannot
hide. If observers are momentarily distracted however, the
character can attempt to hide. While the observer averts its
attention from the character, the character can attempt to get to
a hiding place. This check, however, is at a -10 penalty because
the character has to move quickly to the hiding place. A rogue
cannot hide if there is nothing to hide behind or conceal oneself
with. Deep shadows can count as concealment at the Castle
Keeper’s discretion.</p>

<p>Rogues cannot hide and move silently at the same time until
they reach 3rd level. At this level and beyond, a rogue can
attempt both but must make a successful conceal and move
silent check at -5. In this case, movement is reduced to one
quarter the normal movement rate.</p>

<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_listen">LISTEN (WISDOM)</h5>
A rogue can use this ability to listen
intently and hear noises that others might not detect, even
through an obstacle such as a door. Success indicates the
rogue can hear soft sounds, like a whisper or cat stalking,
while outside or in the open and up to a range of 30 feet. It
also indicates success if the rogue is listening for sounds on
the other side of a door, but the rogue must be adjacent to
the door. However, exactly what is heard is up to the Castle
Keeper’s discretion as each case is unique. If listening through
a stone wall, the rogue suffers a -10 penalty to the check. For
other materials, vary the penalty as appropriate. A rogue can
retry this ability once a round.
This ability is affected by wearing a metal or large helmet.

<h5 id="rogue_move_silently">MOVE SILENTLY (DEXTERITY)</h5>
This ability allows
a rogue to move so silently that others cannot hear the
movement. The rogue can use this ability both indoors and
outdoors. A rogue can move up to one-half the character’s
normal speed at no penalty. At more than one-half and up to
the character’s full speed, the character suffers a -5 penalty.
It’s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while
running or charging.
<p>To move silently and hide, see the hide ability.</p>
<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>


<h5 id="rogue_open_lock">OPEN LOCK (DEXTERITY)</h5>
A rogue can use this ability to
open any sort of mechanical lock that would normally require
a key to open. A successful check indicates the lock has been
opened. This ability requires the use of a set of rogue’s tools,
including picks, blank keys, wires or other appropriate tools. A
rogue may only make one attempt per lock. If that attempt fails,
the rogue cannot try to open the same lock again until gaining
one more level as it is beyond the current ability of the rogue
to pick it.
<p>To move silently and hide, see the hide ability.</p>
<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability</p>

<h5 id="rogue_pick_pocket">PICK POCKET (DEXTERITY)</h5>
A rogue can use this ability,
on a successful dexterity check, to remove the contents of a
pocket or pouch (or otherwise take something from a person)
without being noticed. Success may require the rogue to cut the
purse or pouch from the target. A penalty to check is equal to
the level or hit dice of the targeted victim.
<p>This ability also allows the rogue to perform “sleight of hand”
maneuvers. A successful dexterity check indicates the rogue has
hidden or moved an item in such a manner so that observers
are not aware of where the item has been hidden. Such
typical maneuvers are hiding a coin, sliding a card up a sleeve,
performing the shell game, and the like. A penalty to the check
may be applied if there is an observer present that is determined
to note where an item is moved. This penalty is equal to the
wisdom attribute bonus for the observer.</p>

<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_traps">TRAPS (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
A rogue has three ways to use
this ability: finding, disabling or setting traps. Each use requires
a separate attribute check and each check may be made only
once in a given circumstance. The player must also describe
how the actions are being performed to use this ability.

<p>To find a trap, a rogue spends time intently studying and
searching an area to deduce possible trap locations. It takes
one round to locate a trap in a specific area such as a lock
or a doorknob, and one minute to locate a trap in a 10 by 10
foot area. A successful check indicates the rogue finds one
trap, if any are present. The trap discovered is the simplest
or most obvious trap in the area. If multiple traps are in an
area, multiple successful checks are required to find them all.
A rogue can find magical traps with this ability, although it
may be much more difficult than finding mundane traps. The
Castle Keeper determines any penalties to the check basing
those penalties on the level or hit dice of those who set them.</p>
<p>To disable a trap, a rogue must first know its location. Once
a trap is located, a successful check means the rogue has
disarmed the trap. The attempt can only be made once and
failure indicates that the rogue set off the trap. A rogue can
disarm a magic trap, although it may be much more difficult
than disarming a mundane trap. In most cases, rogue’s tools
are needed to disarm a trap. Generally, it takes 1d4 rounds to
disarm a trap, depending on its complexity.</p>
<p>To set a trap, or to reset a previously disabled trap, a rogue must
make a successful traps check. If a rogue is resetting a trap that
was previously disabled, the rogue gains a +5 bonus to the check.
The amount of time required to set or reset a trap depends on the
complexity of the trap, typically taking 1d4 rounds.
</p>

<p>Locating traps is not affected by the armor worn. However,
disabling and setting traps is affected by wearing armor not on
the armor list for the rogue.</p>

<h5 id="rogue_sneak_attack">SNEAK ATTACK</h5>
At 4th level, a rogue has learned to adapt back
attack skills to more general situations. When an opponent or victim
is aware of the rogue, but unsuspecting of an attack, a rogue can
use the sneak attack ability. For example, a rogue could be having a
conversation with a potential victim while hiding a poisoned stiletto
up his sleeve, intending to strike once a piece of vital information
is learned. Or, a rogue could be perched in the shadows of a tree,
waiting for the perfect opportunity to fire a crossbow. Unlike the
back attack, sneak attack situations do not necessarily require a
previously successful hide or move silently check, although the
Castle Keeper could require success in one or both, depending upon
the circumstances if necessary. The opponent is not allowed to roll
for initiative until the round following the attack.

<p>A rogue making a sneak attack gains a +2 bonus to hit and a
+4 bonus to damage. Ranged weapons can be used for sneak
attacks if the target is within 30 feet. A rogue cannot aim with
deadly accuracy from beyond that range. A sneak attack cannot
be combined with back attack.</p>

<p>Wearing armor not on the rogue armor list affects this ability.</p>
