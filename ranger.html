<h5 id="ranger_combat_marauder">COMBAT MARAUDER</h5>
Rangers possess an extraordinary
ability to combat their most common foes, humanoids and
giants, due to intense training and study of their enemy’s
fighting techniques. When fighting humanoids (bugbears,
gnolls, goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, orcs and the like)
or giants (giants, ogres and the like), a ranger inflicts
extra damage. This damage bonus is +1 at 1st level, with
an additional +1 gained at every level beyond first. For
example, a 5th level ranger would inflict an additional 5
hp of damage for each successful hit against a humanoid or
giant. The use of this ability is dependent upon the armor
worn. Wearing armors other than those allowed reduces the
ranger’s mobility and swiftness of arm such that he cannot
effectively use this ability.

<h5 id="ranger_conceal">CONCEAL (DEXTERITY)</h5>
Rangers can conceal themselves
extremely well in wilderness areas. With a successful dexterity
check, rangers can camouflage themselves so well as to be
unnoticeable by most passers-by. Rangers cannot conceal
themselves and move silently at the same time until they reach
5th level. At this level and beyond, a ranger can attempt both
but must make a successful conceal and move silent check at
-5. In this case, movement is reduced to one quarter the normal
movement rate.
Rangers cannot conceal themselves if being observed, even
casually, before the conceal check is attempted. If the observer
is momentarily distracted, the ranger can attempt to use this
ability. While the observer averts its attention, the character
can attempt to get to a hiding place of some kind. The attribute
check, however, is at a -10 penalty because the character has to
move quickly to the hiding place.
This ability cannot be used if armors other than those allowed
are worn.

<h5 id="ranger_delay/neutralize_poison"> DELAY/NEUTRALIZE POISON (WISDOM) </h5>
A knowledge of
flora and fauna enables a ranger to identify dangerous toxins
and their symptoms, and rangers can apply remedies to slow
or even nullify their effects. This ability can only be used with
natural poisons (animals, plants, fungi, etc.) familiar to the
ranger – usually those found in the region where the ranger
spends most of their time, be it forest, desert or mountain. The
only manufactured poisons with which a ranger is familiar are
those produced by their favored enemy (see below). To succeed
at this task, the ranger must have access to herbs and antidotes.
The Castle Keeper must decide if the herbs are available or
antidotes can be produced.

<p>On a successful delay poison roll, the ranger can temporarily
delay the effect of poisons. The onset or continuation of the
effects of the poison are delayed for one hour per level of the
ranger. This does not cure any damage the poison may have
already caused. It takes one round to perform this action and
the ranger may make only one attempt at this task.</p>


<p>If the delay poison roll exceeds the total score needed for success
by 6 or more, then the ranger has successfully neutralized the
poison in the victim. The afflicted creature suffers no additional
damage or effect from the poison. Any temporary effects are
ended, but the neutralization of the poison does not reverse any
damage or effects that have already occurred.</p>


<h5 id="ranger_move_silently"> MOVE SILENTLY (DEXTERITY) </h5>
The ranger is able to
move silently in wilderness areas with a successful dexterity
check. The ranger can move up to one-half the character’s
normal speed at no penalty. At more than one-half and up to
the character’s full speed, the character suffers a -5 penalty.
It’s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while
running or charging. Rangers cannot perform this ability
indoors. See conceal above for information on moving silently
while attempting to conceal oneself.

<p>This ability cannot be used if armors other than those allowed
are worn.</p>

<h5 id=ranger_scale>SCALE (DEXTERITY)</h5>
With this ability, rangers can climb
and scale typical natural slopes and inclines, such as steep
but rocky hillsides. No attribute check is needed to scale such
surfaces.
Additionally, this extraordinary ability allows a ranger
to climb up, down, or across a dangerous natural slope or
inverted incline that others would find impossible to climb.
When doing so, the ranger moves at one-half the character’s
normal speed. A failed scale check means that the character
makes no progress. A check that fails by 5 or more means
that the character falls from the currently attained height
and must suffer falling damage.
In both situations above, nothing can be carried in the ranger’s
hands while climbing. Also, the ability cannot be used if armors
other than those allowed are worn.

<h5 id=ranger_traps>TRAPS (WISDOM)</h5>
A ranger is able to detect and build simple
traps in a wilderness environment. When passing within 25 feet
of a wilderness trap, a ranger is entitled to an attribute check to
spot it. When actively searching for traps, the ranger receives a
+2 bonus to the check. It takes one round to locate a trap in a
5 by 5 foot area, or one minute spent searching to locate a trap
in a 25 by 25 foot area. A ranger cannot find magical traps with
this ability.

<p>A ranger can set simple traps in a wilderness environment.
These include snares, pit traps and similar devices. Rangers
cannot set complicated mechanical traps such as those found
on treasure chests or on doorways. On a successful traps check,
the ranger successfully builds and conceals a snare or pit trap.
Snares can capture and hold creatures of up to medium height,
and pit traps can be dug to deliver 1d4 points of damage (halved
if the creature falling in it makes a successful dexterity saving
throw). Rangers can also disable simple wilderness traps (of any
type they can build) with little or no effort. No traps check need
be made to do this.</p>

<h5 id=ranger_survival>SURVIVAL (WISDOM)</h5>

In wilderness environments the
character can find shelter, food and water for themselves,
start a fire, and determine direction. As long as adequate
food, water, and shelter sources are present in the
environment, the ranger can find food, water and shelter
without the need for an attribute check. Also, a ranger can
start a fire in 1d10 minutes by natural means, as long as the
needed materials are available. A ranger also can determine
true north in relation to the character, as long as he is in a
wilderness environment.

<p>A ranger can also provide decent food and water for several
people without the need for an attribute check unless it is a
large number of people. The ranger must spend 8 hours hunting
and gathering to produce enough food and water to feed 2-8
people for a day. If the ranger wishes to feed or shelter a larger
group of people than the die indicate, a successful wisdom check
is necessary. If successful, the ranger must spend an additional 8
hours gathering food to feed and water an additional 2-8 people.
This additional effort allows the ranger to gather food and water
for up to 4-16 creatures. The ranger can only hunt and forage
for food twice per day.</p>

<h5 id=ranger_track>TRACK (WISDOM)</h5>
The ranger can successfully track any
creature in a wilderness setting that leaves a discernable trace.
They can also determine characteristics about the creature
being tracked. With a successful wisdom check, a ranger can
find and follow a creature’s tracks or trail for 5 hours. The
ranger can also hide tracks at the same level of ability.

<p>When tracking or hiding tracks from humanoids or giants,
a ranger receives a +2 bonus to the attribute check. The
Castle Keeper may apply bonuses or penalties for varying conditions, such as the length of time elapsed since the tracks
were made, weather conditions, the number of creatures
tracked and whether the tracked creature moved through
water or a secret door.</p>

<p>A successful track check may also impart information about
the creature(s) being tracked. Once a trail is found, a track
check can determine the general number and type of creatures
being tracked. The number of creatures tracked should be
disclosed to the player by using one of the following categories:
individuals (1-6), band (6-30), troop (20-100), or army
(100+), and also one from the following categories: beast,
fey, giant, humanoid, plant, vermin, or other (aberration,
construct, dragon, elemental, magical beast, ooze, outsider,
shapechanger, or undead). For many creatures, the ranger can
not identify its exact type; only that it is a creature of such
nature until some experience has been gained tracking it. A
ranger can identify specific animal tracks with no effort. After
having tracked a particular type of creature several times, the
ranger can later identify its tracks.</p>

<p>At 3rd level, a ranger can ascertain distinguishing characteristics
about the creatures tracked, such as whether they are
wounded, exhausted, carrying heavy objects or wearing
certain armor. The ranger might even be able to determine
if a spellcaster is in the group being tracked. The marks or
characteristics determined are limited only by the Castle
Keeper’s imagination and desire to provide or enhance story
elements during game play.</p>

<p>At 5th level, a ranger can identify the specific type of creature(s)
being tracked if belonging to one of the following categories
and with which the ranger has had some interaction: beast, fey,
giant, humanoid, plant or vermin.</p>

<h5 id=ranger_favored_enemy>FAVORED ENEMY</h5>
At 6th level, a ranger chooses one specific
type of creature as a favored enemy. For example, a ranger might
choose goblin, or gnoll or hill giant. The Castle Keeper should
require the player to choose an enemy that is consistent with
the past history and storylines involving the character; ideally, a
type of creature that the character has encountered and fought
on several occasions in past adventures.

<p>Knowledge of the favored enemy confers numerous bonuses
to the ranger’s ability checks. When combating a favored
enemy, the ranger gains additional combat bonuses due to
an advanced fighting style developed through the experience
of repeatedly fighting that type of creature. The ranger gains
a +2 bonus to hit against a favored enemy. The ranger also
receives a +2 bonus to armor class when fighting a favored
enemy. Further, when tracking the favored enemy, the ranger
receives a +2 bonus to the tracking check. The ranger is
also able to neutralize poisons of the favored enemy, whether
manufactured or natural.</p>

<p>The combat bonus of this ability cannot be used if armors other
than those allowed are worn.</p>
