<h5 id="assassin_special">SPECIAL</h5>
Assassins must be prepared to wait in hidden places
for long hours and move swiftly and quietly when attacking.
Heavy armor that is uncomfortable, noisy or bulky precludes
optimum performance. An assassin may wear leather armor, a
leather coat, or padded armor, and can employ small shields
without any penalty to the use of the character’s abilities. They
may also wear leather helmets. An assassin may wear any other
type of armor, but the character may suffer a penalty when using
class abilities and wearing these armors as noted in the ability
description. The penalty is equal to -1 for each point above
armor class 12 those armors confer. Restricted helmets and
shields cause the assassin to suffer a –1 penalty to all abilities.
All penalties are cumulative.

<h5 id="assassin_case_target">CASE TARGET (WISDOM)</h5>
Using this ability, the assassin
can determine information and weaknesses about a potential
opponent or target through detailed observation and deductive
reasoning. An assassin must spend 1d3x10 minutes observing
an opponent before a check is allowed. A successful check
results in knowledge of the approximate level or HD of the
opponent within 10%, alignment, hidden weapons or unusual
items, distinguishing habits and mannerisms, and any other
details that might not be apparent to normal observation. The
CK must decide what the assassin can learn about the target
and deems appropriate to convey. This check can be adjusted
by the level or hit dice of the observed creature.
This ability is unaffected by wearing armor not on the assassin
armor list but is affected by helmets.

<h5 id="assassin_climb">CLIMB (DEXTERITY)</h5>
This extraordinary ability allows an
assassin to climb up, down, or across a slope, wall, steep incline
(even a ceiling with handholds), or unusually angled natural or
man made slope or incline that others would find impossible
to climb. When doing so, the assassin moves at one-half the
character’s normal speed. A failed climb check means that the
character makes no progress. A check that fails by 5 or more
means that the character falls from the currently attained
height, and must suffer falling damage. Assassins can not carry
anything in their hands while climbing. When climbing typical
natural slopes and man made inclines, such as a cliff faces or
steep steps, an assassin does not need to make an attribute
check to climb the surface.

<h5 id="assassin_death_attack">DEATH ATTACK</h5>
If an assassin studies a victim for 3 rounds and
makes a sneak attack (see below) that successfully deals damage,
the sneak attack can potentially kill the target instantly. While
studying a victim prior to an attack, the assassin can undertake
other actions, but must stay focused on the target. If the target
knows the assassin is present, a death attack is not possible. The
victim of such an attack must make a constitution saving throw.
If the saving throw fails, the victim dies instantly. If the saving
throw succeeds, the attack is treated as a normal sneak attack.
After completing 3 rounds of study, the assassin must attack
within the next 3 rounds to use this ability. If a death attack is
attempted and fails because the victim succeeds at the saving
throw, the assassin cannot make another attempt at a death
attack in this circumstance because the victim will almost
certainly be aware of the assassin’s status as an enemy. If the
assassin attacks and misses (and the target is not aware of the
attack), or if the assassin does not launch the attack within
3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are
required before attempting another death attack.

<h5 id="assassin_disguise">DISGUISE (CHARISMA)</h5>
With a successful check in this
ability, assassins can disguise themselves or impersonate people.
The ability allows the assassin to impersonate general types of
people, as well as individuals. For example, a human assassin
might impersonate a taller elf mage, or perhaps a traveler, even
though the assassin is a local.

For a general impersonation such as a beggar or merchant, the
effort requires a few props, makeup, and 1d3x10 minutes of work
to complete. Where specific individuals are being impersonated,
at least one month’s preparation time is required to avoid
detection. A disguise can include an apparent change of height
or weight of no more than one-tenth the original height or
weight of the assassin. The Castle Keeper makes the character’s
disguise check secretly so that the character is not sure of its
success. The following penalties are applied to a disguise check
when appropriate: sex difference -2, race difference -2, and a -2
for an age difference of more than ten years.

A successful disguise does not fool an observer in all instances.
Success indicates that the assassin is disguised well enough to
fool normal, non-suspicious observers. If a suspicious individual
observes the assassin, the CK may allow the observer an intelligence
check to see through the disguise. If an assassin is impersonating a
particular individual, all who know that individual are permitted to
make an intelligence check to detect the disguise. If the observer
would recognize the impersonated individual on sight, the check is
made at +4. If the observer is a friend or close associate, the check
is made at +8 and if intimate, the check is at +12.

<h5 id="assassin_hide">HIDE (DEXTERITY)</h5>
Assassins use this ability to conceal
themselves from others. A successful check means that the
assassin is hidden so well as to be almost invisible. The assassin
can move up to one-half normal speed and remain hidden. Hide
checks suffer no penalty in this circumstance. At more than
one-half and up to full speed, the character suffers a -5 penalty
to the check to remain hidden. It’s practically impossible (-20
penalty) to hide while running or charging.
If the character is being observed, even casually, they can’t hide. If
observers are momentarily distracted however, the character can
attempt to hide. While the observer averts its attention from the
character, the character can attempt to get to a hiding place. This
check, however, is at a –10 penalty because the character has to
move quickly to the hiding place. An assassin cannot hide if there
is nothing to hide behind or conceal oneself with. Deep shadows
can count as concealment at the Castle Keeper’s discretion.
Assassins cannot hide and move silently at the same time until
they reach 3rd level. At this level and beyond, an assassin can
attempt both but must make a successful conceal and move
silent check at -5. In this case, movement is reduced to one
quarter the normal movement rate.
This ability is affected by wearing armor not on the assassin
armor list.

<h5 id="assassin_listen">LISTEN (WISDOM)</h5>
An assassin can use this ability to listen
intently and hear noises that others might not detect, even
through an obstacle such as a door. Success indicates the assassin
can hear soft sounds, like a whisper or cat stalking, while outside
or in the open and up to a range of 30 feet. It also indicates success
if the assassin is listening for sounds on the other side of a door,
but the assassin must be adjacent to the door. However, exactly
what is heard is up to the Castle Keeper’s discretion as each case
is unique. If listening through a stone wall, the assassin suffers a
-10 penalty to the check. For other materials, vary the penalty as
appropriate. An assassin can retry this ability once a round.
This ability is affected by wearing a metal or large helmet.

<h5 id="assassin_move_silently">MOVE SILENTLY (DEXTERITY)</h5>
This ability allows an assassin
to move so silently that others cannot hear the movement. The
assassin can use this ability both indoors and outdoors. An
assassin can move up to one-half the character’s normal speed at
no penalty. At more than one-half and up to the character’s full
speed, the character suffers a -5 penalty. It’s practically impossible
(-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging.
To move silently and hide, see the hide ability. This ability is
affected by wearing armor not on the armor list for the assassin.

<h5 id="assassin_poisons">POISONS (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
An assassin can identify and make
poisons and antitoxins. An assassin can identify a poison or
antitoxin on a successful check. To make a poison or antitoxin,
the assassin needs some alchemical equipment and raw
materials costing one third of the street value of the poison
or antitoxin to be made. An assassin’s training in the use of
poison means that an assassin never risks accidental poisoning
when applying poison to a blade. Moreover, assassins train with
poisons of all types, and they slowly grow more resistant to their
effects. This is reflected by a +1 bonus to saving throws versus
poisons gained at 3rd level. Some common poisons, their effects
and costs are listed below.

<h5 id="assassin_sneak_attack">SNEAK ATTACK</h5>
Assassins are capable of quick and deadly
strikes upon unsuspecting targets. When an opponent or victim
is aware of the assassin, but unsuspecting of any attack, this
ability can be used. For example, an assassin could casually
walk next to a target, quickly stabbing him with a poisoned
blade. These situations do not necessarily require a previously
successful hide or move silently check, although the Castle
Keeper could require success in one or both skills, depending
upon the circumstances. The opponent is not allowed to roll for
initiative until the round following the attack.
An assassin making a sneak attack gains a +2 bonus to hit and
a +4 bonus to damage. Ranged weapons can be used for sneak
attacks if the target is within 30 feet. An assassin cannot aim
with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.
This ability is affected by wearing armor not on the assassin
armor list.

<h5 id="assassin_traps">TRAPS (INTELLIGENCE)</h5>
An assassin may use this to do
one of the following: find, disable or set traps. Each use requires
a separate attribute check and each check may be made only
once in a given circumstance.
To find a trap, an assassin spends time intently studying and
searching an area to deduce possible trap locations. It takes
one round to locate a trap in a specific area such as a lock or a
doorknob, and one minute to locate a trap in a 10 by 10 foot
area. A successful check indicates the assassin finds one trap,
if any are present. The trap discovered is the simplest or most
obvious trap in the area. If multiple traps are in an area, multiple
successful checks are required to find them all. An assassin can
find magical traps with this ability, although it may be much
more difficult than finding mundane traps. The Castle Keeper
determines any penalties to the check basing those penalties on
the level or hit dice of those who set them.
To disable a trap, an assassin must first know its location. Once
a trap is located, a successful check means the assassin has
disarmed the trap. The attempt can only be made once and
failure indicates that the assassin set off the trap. An assassin
can disarm a magic trap, although it may be much more difficult
than disarming a mundane trap. In most cases, assassin’s tools
are needed to disarm a trap. Generally, it takes 1d4 rounds to
disarm a trap, depending on its complexity.
To set a trap, or to reset a previously disabled trap, an assassin must
make a successful traps check. If an assassin is resetting a trap
that they previously disabled, the assassin gains a +5 bonus to the
check. The amount of time required to set or reset a trap depends
on the complexity of the trap, typically taking 1d4 rounds.
