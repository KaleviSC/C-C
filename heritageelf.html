<br><br>


<h3>Affinity to Nature</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf

<p>Some elves are so attuned to natural surroundings that they can
sense when something is wrong or sense the presence of danger
before they are consciously aware of it.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Elves who select this advantage gain a +1 on checks to
avoid surprise, to detect hidden foes, and to initiative when in
natural surroundings, but because they are so attuned to natural
settings they are disconcerted when not in the wilderness, and
suffer a penalty of -1 on these checks in those unnatural settings.

<br><br>

<h3>Arcane Training</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf, able to cast wizard spells

<p>Some elves have a natural aptitude for magic and spend much
of their youth refining the ability to work spells. As a result, the
spells they cast are more powerful, but they do not train in other
areas as other elves do.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Elves who choose this advantage add 1 to the challenge
level of saves vs. their spells, but because they spent their time
studying magic and not martial skills, they suffer a -2 penalty on
all attacks with weapons.

<br><br>

<h3>Orc Hunter</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf, BtH +1

<p>Years of skirmishing against orcs have yielded effective tactics
to best kill them.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Elves who take this advantage gain +1d4 points
of damage with each successful attack when fighting orcs.
However, they cannot hide their eagerness to kill orcs and suffer
a -2 on all reactions with orcs and half-orcs.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The elf can take this advantage multiple times. Each
time it is taken, the bonus damage die improves by 1, i.e. +1d6
the second time it is taken, +1d8 the third time, etc., and each
time it is taken, there is an additional -2 penalty to reactions.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Silent Stalker</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf

<p>Some elves have adapted their skill at moving silently to other
environments than their traditional natural surroundings.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Elves who take this advantage can move silently in all
environments (wilderness, dungeons, cities, etc.), not just in
wilderness areas.

<br><br>

<h3>Weapon Master</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf, +1 BtH

<p>Some elves receive advanced training in the ways of combat, exceeding the skill
   of most elves with their weapon of choice.
However, this extra training leaves them less adept with other
weapons.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b>Elves who select this advantage gain an additional +2
to hit with the weapon they selected for their weapon training
ability. However, they suffer a -1 penalty to hit with all other
weapons, as the extra training with their chosen weapon led to
the neglect of other martial skills.

<br><br>

<h3>Wisdom of the Ages</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Elf

<p>Because elves are such a long-lived race and treasure learning,
they often know obscure or eclectic bits of lore and knowledge.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b>Elves who select this advantage gain a +1 on all
intelligence checks to determine if they know about some topic.
