<h5 id="knight_birthright_mount">BIRTHRIGHT MOUNT</h5>
A trained and healthy mount is
important to a knight’s station and status. In addition to their
starting money, knights begin play with a fully outfitted riding
horse (saddle, blankets, saddlebags, bit and bridle, harness,
horseshoes, and meal). The mounts are hardier than most,
having 2d8+2 hit points. A riding horse is not trained for
combat, and a knight has some difficulty fighting from a riding
horse (see mounted combat).
<br>
<p> <b>Riding Horse:</b> (Their vital stats are HD 2d8+2, AC 13,
MV 60. Their primary attributes are physical. They attack with
2 hooves for 1d4+1 points of damage.)</p>
<p><b>Light War Horse:</b> (Their vital stats are HD 3d10, AC14,
MV 60. Their primary attributes are physical. They attack with 2
hooves for 1d4+2, or a bite for 1d4 points of damage.)</p>

<h5 id="knight_horsemanship">HORSEMANSHIP (DEXTERITY)</h5>
Knights are trained in mounted combat and are familiar with all types of horses, from
mounts used for riding to heavy war horses. Without the need
for an attribute check, knights can saddle, mount, ride and
dismount; perform simple leaps and obstacle maneuvers (no
more than 3 feet in height and move around small items such as
barrels); fight from a mount during combat (melee and ranged)
without penalty; control the mount in combat; guide a mount
with the knees; and stay in the saddle when a mount rears or
bolts. When viewing a horse or a group of mounts, knights can
determine the strengths and weaknesses of each horse, and can
generally pick out the strongest, fastest or all-around best horse.
When fighting from a war-trained mount (light to heavy war
horse), a knight can direct the mount to attack and still make
his or her attack normally.

<p>With a successful check, and by foregoing any attack or
other action, knights may direct their mounts to perform the
following actions while mounted: cover, deflect, fall softly, leap
and charge.</p>
<p><b>Cover:</b> A knight can drop and hang alongside a mount, using
it as three-fourth’s cover.
This grants a +6 bonus to the knight’s armor class from those
on the opposite side of the horse. The knight cannot attack
or be holding anything while using this ability.</p>
<p><b>Deflect: </b>This entails the mount being moved between the
opponent and the knight or positioned to offer maximum cover
for the knight, while at the same time allowing the mount to
avoid blows. This maneuver gives a +4 bonus to the knight’s
armor class and a +2 bonus to the mount’s armor class.</p>
<p><b>Fall Softly:</b>A knight can attempt to take no damage after
falling from a mount, by rolling to the side or leaping off,
including when the mount itself falls. A character takes 1d6
points of falling damage on any failed attribute check.</p>
<p><b>Leap: </b>The knight may direct a mount to leap obstacles as
part of its movement. The obstacles jumped can be no taller
than 2/3 rds. the height of the horse.</p>
<p><b>Charge: </b>A knight is well trained in the use of a lance. When
fighting from a mount and charging, a knight inflicts triple
damage upon a successful hit when wielding a lance.</p>

<h5 id="knight_inspire">INSPIRE </h5>
The mere presence of a knight upon the field of
battle can alter the mood of armies and change the tide of
combat. This gives the knight the ability to inspire companions
and followers. Any person friendly to a knight’s immediate
endeavor gains a bonus to hit equal to the knight’s charisma
modifier. This ability can be used once per day and lasts a
number of rounds equal to the knight’s level. The number of
persons that are affected increases as the knight gains levels. At
1st level, the knight can affect up to 12 creatures. The ability
affects up to 25 creatures at 3rd level, up to 50 creatures at 5th
level, up to 250 creatures at 7th level, up to 1000 creatures at 9th
level, up to 5,000 creatures at 12th level and 20,000 creatures
at 16th level. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with
embolden or demoralize.

<h5 id="knight_embolden">EMBOLDEN </h5>
At 3rd level, the knight’s confidence and
fearlessness in the face of danger instills courage in their
companions and followers. Any companions or followers
within 30 feet of the knight gains a bonus of +1 to strength,
constitution, dexterity, and intelligence saving throws, and a
+2 to wisdom and charisma saving throws. This ability can be
used once per day and lasts a number of rounds equal to the
knight’s level. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with
demoralize or inspire.

<h5 id="knight_demoralize">DEMORALIZE </h5>
At 5th level, the knight causes fear and dread
in the ranks of foes and enemy forces. Enemies to the knight’s
immediate endeavor suffer a penalty of -4 to charisma checks. In
addition, the affected foes must successfully save versus fear at
a -4 penalty or suffer a -1 penalty to hit. This ability can be used
once per day and lasts a number of rounds equal to the knight’s
level. The number of creatures that can be affected increases as
the knight gains levels. At 5th level, the knight can affect up to
25 creatures. The ability affects up to 100 creatures at 7th level,
up to 250 creatures at 9th level, up to 1,000 creatures at 12th
level and 5,000 creatures at 16th level. This ability cannot be
use in conjunction with embolden and inspire.

<h5 id="knight_battlefield_dominance">BATTLEFIELD DOMINANCE </h5>
At 8th level, the knight can
use demoralize, embolden and inspire in the same round. This is
in addition to their regular use individually.

<h5 id="knight_call_to_arms">CALL TO ARMS</h5>

At 10th level, a knight reaches a level of
renown that allows him to attract followers to his cause. By
establishing a stronghold, a knight can attract 2d10 followers
of 0 level every month. For every 40 followers that flock to
the knight’s standard, a 1st level knight heeds the call as well.
When 80 followers have been attracted, a knight of at least
5th level is attracted. This cycle repeats until the knight can
no longer pay for the upkeep of his followers. Thus, when 120
followers are reached, another 1st level knight comes, and when
160 followers are reached, another 5th level knight arrives.
Followers must be supported or they leave. 0 level followers
require 2gp per month and 1st level knights cost 100 gp per
month. Every knight of a higher level requires 100 gp per level
per month.

<h5>TYPICAL KNIGHLTY VIRTUES</h5>
The Castle Keeper and the player should develop the details
and expectations for a knight character prior to play as courtesy
will vary from campaign to campaign. The following is a typical
code of conduct for a knight.

<p><b>Courage:</b>To flee in fear from a battle or from a struggle that
might be won is dishonorable and churlish. So long as any hope
remains, the knight is bound to fight until death or victory is
won. Personal interests bow to service of the cause. Courage
however, is guided by wisdom and truth.</p>
<p><b>Defense:</b>A knight should defend liege, nation, family and
all those who depend upon the knight, or all those deemed
worthy of their protection. Sacrificing oneself for these would
be considered a worthy and noble death.</p>
 <p><b>Discreetness: </b>A knight is discreet in affairs with friends and
 others. Slander is uncalled for, and that which is not seen or
 heard personally should not be repeated. A knight should not
 demean others, gossip, spread malicious lies or commit slander.
 Even enemies are treated with respect.</p>

<p><b>Excellence: </b>The knight should strive for excellence in
everything, whether the art of war or the gentler arts of the court.
Excellence is marked by commitment, zeal, attitude and conduct.</p>
Faith: Knights must have faith in their beliefs, for only faith
provides courage and loyalty. A knight’s faith provides a shield
against the darkness of despair.
<p><b>Honor: </b>A knight should be honest in dealing with others, being
quick to remedy or make restitution for injustice. A knight
keeps his word and follows through on commitments. A knight
performs deeds that bring honor to his or her liege and to the
office of knighthood. A knight shall not attack an unarmed foe,
or one asking for mercy.</p>
<p><b>Humility: </b>A knight values the contributions of others and
their deeds of reknown. Telling the deeds of others glorifies
the office of knighthood. It is unseemly for knights to boast
of their own deeds, for a knight’s reknown, if truly earned,
will be noted by peers. Only the weak trumpet their own
accomplishments.
Justice: A knight should seek the path of “right”,
unencumbered by personal bias and interest. A knight strives to
punish the guilty, while remembering that justice without mercy
can itself be unjust. A knight treats others with fairness and
honesty, and mediates disputes without malice.
Largesse: A knight is expected to be as generous as possible. A
knight should be willing to provide aid to friends and allies, and
even to other knights, with no thought of repayment, for those
of a chivalrous demeanor will repay the knight in kind and in
full measure.</p>

<p><b>Loyalty: </b>The knight’s word is a bond, and an oath once sworn
should never be refuted, save when an oath-bond is broken by
the other party. A knight should be unwavering in commitment
to liege and cause, family and faith, code and ideals. A knight
keeps sacred any confidence entrusted.
Nobility: A knight seeks stature by upholding the virtues of
knighthood, though knowing that perfection is impossible.
Only by striving for perfection, however, does a knight achieve
greatness of character and spirit.
Valor: A knight seeks to uphold the office of knighthood, and
faces death with valor.</p>
