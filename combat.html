<h3 id="surprise">Surprise</h3>
Before combat begins, the CK determines if one or the other
party is surprised. Those that are surprised get no action.
After the surprise round, combat proceeds normally.

<p>If a party can be surprised, a wisdom attribute check
is made by the individual in the group with the best chance of
succeeding at it, or by each member of the group individually. If
the check is successful, that party or individual is not surprised.
Failure indicates surprise.</p>

<p>If a party is well hidden or camouflaged and awaiting a group of
poorly perceptive orcs on a brightly lit road, the Castle Keeper
may decide to penalize the wisdom check for the orcs. In general,
the bonus or penalty should remain within a range of -5 to +5,
although it might be greater in extraordinary situations.</p>

<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
The order of action in a combat round is determined by an
initiative roll. Every creature or character participating in the
combat round rolls a d10 to determine their initiative each
round. Those with the highest roll take their action first, and
the actions of others descend from there. In the case of a tie,
the one with the highest dexterity goes first. In the case of equal
dexterity, a simultaneous action occurs.
<p>This method of establishing initiative may seem chaotic at
times, especially with large groups of creatures or characters. In
those cases, the Castle Keeper may find it necessary to require
a group initiative instead, with the winning party acting before
anyone in the opponent party.</p>

<p>There is one exception to initiative: when a creature uses
a weapon with a reach of greater than 10 feet against an
opponent with a weapon with less than a 6 foot reach, or when
a large creature is fighting a medium or smaller sized creature.
In the first round only, the creature with the longer reach or
larger size is allowed to attack first, even if the creature with the
shorter reach or smaller size won the initiative roll. This rule
only applies if the creature with the shorter reach or smaller
creature approaches within ten feet. Such action counts as the
action for that round for the larger creature or the one with the
longer weapon.</p>

<h3 id="combat_actions">Combat Actions</h3>
In a combat round, characters can perform a wide variety of
actions. Every possible action, however, can be categorized in one
of the five types of actions that may be performed during combat,
which all have a chance of failure. The five possible actions are
attack, cast a spell, move, use an ability or use an item.

<h4 id="attack">Attack</h4>
A character or monster is allowed one attack each round
unless they possess a special ability allowing them to exceed the
limitation. Attacks include melee attacks, either armed with a
weapon or unarmed, and ranged attacks with a missile weapon.
An attack allows a character or monster to move up to one-half
their movement rate. Moving farther than one-half movement
rate negates the ability to make an attack.

<h4 id="cast_a_spell">Cast a Spell</h4>
A character or creature is allowed to cast one spell each round.
Some spells require two or more rounds to cast, in which case
the character must wait until the following round for the effect
of the spell to take place. The magic section fully details how
spells are cast and when they take effect. A character may not
move any distance and cast a spell in the same round unless the
spell description states otherwise.

<h4 id="move">Move</h4>
If no other action is taken, a character or monster can walk
a distance equal to their full movement rate. Full movement
also includes jogging (twice the normal move rate) and running
(quadruple the normal move rate).

<h4 id="use_an_ability">Use an Ability</h4>
A character or monster may perform one class or racial ability
each round. Some abilities, like spells, take more than one
round to complete. Some monsters can perform more than one
ability per round. Ability may involve movement, but in most
cases the movement will not exceed the normal movement rate.
Otherwise, the Castle Keeper retains discretion as to whether
any ability use involves movement.


<h4 id="use_an_item">Use an Item</h4>
An item that is carried and readied can be used. The most
common actions in this category are using or activating a magic
item or piece of equipment. Such actions include, but are not
limited to, drinking a potion, using a wand, casting a spell from a
scroll, or casting a grappling hook. In most cases, no movement
will be involved or allowed when using an item. Readying an
item is not difficult, as long as it is easily accessed. Usually, the
item must be on a belt or hanging from a pack, and readying it
should not take more than a few seconds. Whereas, if an item
is in a backpack, it would take at least a round to take off the
pack, dig through it, and retrieve the item. The Castle Keeper
and players must use common sense in deciding whether an item
is readily available. In some cases, the Castle Keeper may require
the players to indicate on their character sheets which items are
readily available or how and where an item is being carried.


<h3 id="movement_in_the_combat_round">Movement in the Combat Round</h3>

Once initiative or surprise is determined, each character
or monster involved in combat is allowed an action. One
allowed action is movement. Movement, like the combat
round, is an abstraction. It is a manner of establishing
the distance that can be moved in a given period of time.
Movement can be in a straight line, a curve or around
a corner. Base movement rates are listed in each racial or
monster description. The listed rate is the distance in feet
that can be moved in one combat round. If encumbered,
movement is reduced as described in the encumbrance
section. Movement can be increased by jogging (double the
movement rate) or running (quadruple the movement rate).
Drop all fractions when figuring movement rates (minimum
of 1 foot). To translate the movement rate into inches, hexes,
squares or centimeters, divide the movement rate by 5.

<p>An attacker can move one-half their movement rate and still
attack. No attack is allowed if a character exceeds one-half
their movement rate. The only exception to this rule is when
a charge is attempted. Charging allows for an attack and full
movement, but the special rules for charging apply. The Castle
Keeper has the option of reducing the movement rate due to
terrain, obstacles, injuries or other circumstances. Generally,
the movement rate should not be reduced by more than
three-fourths (0.75). The Castle Keeper should always allow a
character to move at least 5 feet in a combat round, unless the
character is restrained or otherwise unable to move.</p>


<h4 id="charging">Charging</h4>
Charging is a special, movement-based combat maneuver.
When charging, a character precedes a melee attack by jogging
or running, with the intent of using the gained leverage and
momentum to inflict greater damage on a defender. A successful
charge attack results in a +2 bonus to damage inflicted, but
imposes a -4 penalty to the attacker’s armor class for the entire
combat round. The charge must be announced prior to the
character moving and before iniative is rolled.

<p>When charging, a character is considered to be jogging
or running. The character must minimally move the full
distance of their normal movement rate. The charge must be
in a straight line. The total distance moved while charging
cannot exceed the character’s jogging movement rate. For
example, Una the elf announces that she is going to charge
an orc standing across the battlefield. Una’s base movement
is 30 feet, and thus, her jogging rate is 60 feet. As long as the
orc is at least 30 feet away, but no more than 60 feet, Una
may attempt the charge maneuver.</p>

<p>When charging, the attacker suffers a -4 penalty to armor class
for the combat round. The penalty applies even if the charge
attack is not successful. The penalty also applies if the defender
attacks first due to size or weapon length, or by ranged attack.
If a defender scores a successful hit upon a charging character,
the charge is negated. If a charge is negated, the attacker is still
allowed their movement and attack, but a successful hit does
not deal any extra damage.</p>


<h3 id="melee_combat">Melee Combat</h3>
Melee occurs when two creatures engage in hand-to-hand
combat. The attacker rolls a d20 and adds the basic to hit bonus
plus any strength modifier. A monster’s basic to hit bonus is equal
to its total number of hit dice (a 3d8 hit dice creature adds a +3).
If the total is greater than or equal to the defender’s armor class,
the attacker has successfully hit the defender and inflicts damage
as determined by the weapon used. Unarmed combat is a type of
melee attack, but it is addressed separately below

<p>It is important to note that a melee attack, like the combat
round and movement, is also an abstraction. Though a character
usually makes only one attack per round, it should not be
considered a single swing. A melee attack involves a series of
parries and thrusts, along with attack and defensive maneuvers
that sometimes result in damage to the defender. The damage
could be from one blow or could be representative of a series of
blows or fatigue.</p>

<p>There are many other bonuses and penalties which may affect
a melee attack to hit roll. These include, but are not limited to,
racial modifiers, magic weapon bonuses, class ability modifiers,
spell effect modifiers, and situational modifiers.</p>

PAGE 180. PHB: Damage from melee
weapons is adjusted by the strength modifier, magical weapon
bonuses, and other factors or adjustments if applicable.


<h3 id="ranged_combat">Ranged Combat</h3>

Ranged combat is much like melee combat except it occurs when
an attack is made with a missile weapon against a defender some
distance away. Dexterity is the attribute that modifies a ranged
attack to hit roll. If the total of the d20 roll plus the character’s basic
to hit bonus and dexterity modifier is greater than or equal to the
defender’s armor class, the attacker has successfully hit the defender
and inflicts damage as determined by the missile weapon used.

<p>There are two types of ranged weapons: thrown and propelled.
Thrown weapons are those whose momentum are dependent
upon the strength of the character or monster throwing it.
These include javelins, daggers, spears and the like. Propelled
weapons are those whose momentum and thrust are dependent
on the mechanism which propels them forward. This includes
crossbows, stones from a sling and similar devices. While a
character’s dexterity modifier is added to all ranged to hit rolls,
a character’s strength modifier is only added to the damage of
thrown weapons, not propelled weapons</p>


<p>Ranged weapons also have range increments, and they
have a maximum effective distance equal to three times
the listed range increment as detailed in the equipment list.
The listed range increment is considered to be close range.
Twice the range increment is medium range and three times
the increment is long range. Medium range results in a -2
penalty to the ranged attack roll, and long range results in a
-6 penalty to the attack roll.</p>


<p>Ranged weapons that miss their target continue on their path
and can potentially hit another target within close range. If
the target of the attack is missed, the projectile continues in a
straight line and can hit anything in its path. For each ten feet
traveled within close range, the archer should roll a to hit roll
again, but the attacker accrues a -1 penalty for every 10 feet
beyond the original target. The exception to this rule is that
bolts fired from a crossbow continue up to long range, although
the medium and long range modifiers still apply.</p>

<h3 id="unarmed_combat">Unarmed Combat</h3>

Unarmed combat is similar to armed combat, only the attacker
is not using a melee weapon, but natural weapons, such as claws,
hands, fangs or even the whole body. Many monsters employ
unarmed melee attacks, as do monk characters. In most cases,
the success of these attacks are determined as with a normal
melee attack. The attacker rolls a d20 and adds the basic to hit
bonus plus any strength modifier. A monster’s basic to hit bonus is
equal to its total number of hit dice (a 3d8 hit dice creature adds
a +3). If the total is greater than or equal to the defender’s armor
class, the attacker has successfully hit the defender and inflicts
damage as determined by the class ability or monster description.

<p>There are also special unarmed attacks of an entirely different
nature and effect: grappling, pummeling, overbearing and touch
attacks. Each type follows the same basic principle but with
different modifications to the to hit roll and damage inflicted.</p>


<h4 id="grappling">Grappling</h4>
Grappling involves grabbing and holding a defender, as with
classical wrestling or a snake constricting its body around its
prey. Grappling is directed at holding an opponent and subduing
them. The attacker rolls a d20 and adds any strength modifier
and his Bonus to hit (BtH).
<p>The armor class of a defender in an overbearing attack is
different than normal. A defender without strength as a
prime has a standard AC of 12. A defender with strength as
a prime has a standard AC of 18. Armor has little effect on
the capacity to defend against this type of attack and is not
included. The AC is modified by the strength, the dexterity,
and the size difference between the two opponents. If an
attacker is larger than the defender apply a +2 to AC for
every size category larger than the defender’s size, and a -2
for every size category smaller.</p>

<p>Should an attack be successful, the defender is held and cannot
act except to attempt to break the hold. The defender is
considered prone and defenseless. The defender can break the
hold by making his own successful grappling attack.</p>

<h4 id="pummeling">Pummeling</h4>
Much like boxers or martial artists, pummeling involves the
use of fists, feet, knees, elbows or other body parts to inflict
damage on an opponent with the intention of knocking them
out or otherwise incapacitating them. The attacker rolls a d20
to hit, adding any strength modifier plus, his BtH, and any other
modifier the Castle Keeper deems appropriate. If the total equals
or exceeds the defender’s armor class, the pummeling inflicts 1-2
hit points of subdual damage. Damage is modified by strength.

<h4 id="overbearing">Overbearing</h4>
This type of attack is used to knock an opponent down. This
is a tactic used in wrestling and other types of hand-to-hand
combat, as well as when an animal charges and knocks someone
over. The attacker rolls a d20 to hit and adds any strength
modifier or other modifier that the Castle Keeper deems fit. The
Castle Keeper may or may not deem the basic to hit bonus an
appropriate modifier.

<p>The armor class for overbearing attacks is determined in the
same fashion as for grappling attacks, using the defender’s
strength, BtH or hit dice, and size difference as modifiers.
However, unlike grappling attacks, there is one additional
modifier. The defender’s BtH also modifies the armor class in
an overbearing attack.</p>


<p>If a hit is successful, the defender is knocked prone for the
remainder of that round. An attacker cannot knock over a
defender two sizes larger. In addition, the defender takes 1-2
points of subdual damage.</p>

<p>An attacker attempting to overbear suffers a -2 penalty to armor
class because they are more exposed than usual. The penalty
remains to their armor class for the combat round.</p>


<h3 id="touch_attack">Touch Attack</h3>
A touch attack is one in which an attacker is simply trying to
touch an opponent. This often occurs with spells that require
a touch to be successful. With a touch attack, a standard
armor class of 10 is used for all defenders, adjusted only by
dexterity of the defender and special modifiers resulting from,
for example, magic items or spells. Monsters use the base 10
AC with no modifiers.

<h3 id="situational_modifiers">Situational Modifiers</h3>

<p>Situational modifiers are somewhat nebulous and, for the most
part, those that the Castle Keeper deems appropriate. There are
often situations for which it is impossible to set a rule, or would
involve such complex rules as to fill up an entire tome. In these
instances, the Castle Keeper must use reason, common sense or
narrative development to determine what modifier is applied to
the to hit roll. For example, should a fighter, after a long night
of carousing, be swinging across a crowded tavern clinging to a
fraying rope with one hand and a sword in the other, decide to
take a swing at a plump gnome merchant as he passes over it,
the Castle Keeper must decide upon the appropriate modifier to
the to hit roll (or an attribute check to determine if it is even
possible to make the attack).</p>


<p>In general, combat to hit modifiers can be broken down into
three categories: easy, difficult and heroic. For tasks that are
easy, up to a +/-5 modifier should be imposed. Difficult tasks
would range from +/- 6 to 10, and heroic acts would range
from +/- 11 or above. The instance described above may seem
ridiculous, but players attempt all manner of actions with their
characters - something which should be encouraged. However,
the Castle Keeper is left with the task of deciding the modifier
to be applied to a situation. What the fighter in the example
above is attempting is not heroic, but it most certainly is not
easy. In this instance, the Castle Keeper should probably err on
the high side of difficult since the fighter is inebriated. A -10 to
the attack roll would not be unreasonable.</p>

<p>Some situational modifiers can be applied with regularity. These
are listed below and can be used to help in making decisions
about other unusual situations. Concealment includes those
circumstances where nothing physically blocks an attack, but
there is something that interferes with the attacker’s accuracy.
The other modifiers should be self explanatory. The modifiers
are cumulative. In all instances, attackers must know of a
defender’s presence, though not their exact location. Also, the
Castle Keeper should add to this list and keep track of decisions
which are made in the game in order that they can be made
with some regularity and consistency.</p>

<h3 id="armor_class">Armor Class</h3>

<p>Armor class is representative of a defender’s ability to avoid
damage. Armor class results from a combination of armor and
dextrous avoidance of attacks, and even an ability to absorb the
shock of a damaging blow or roll with it. Armor class takes into
account an active defense (aware of the attacker), the armor
worn and a general ability to withstand or avoid attacks. It does
not represent armor alone. However, for game purposes, armor
class is the primary determinate of armor class as it is the most
easy to quantify.</p>


<p>Armor class begins at 10. A person wearing normal clothing has
a 10 armor class. Armor class can increase as much as modifiers
allow. In rare cases, modifiers can result in an armor class less
than 10, though never below 1. The following rules should
be taken into account when determining the armor class of a
defender. It is not an exhaustive list and the Castle Keeper is
encouraged to develop their own adjustments as needed.</p>


<h4>Armor</h4>
Each armor’s adjustment is described in the equipment list.
Chain mail, for example, has a +5 adjustment to armor class.
This gives the individual wearing it a 15 armor class (10+5).

<h4>Shields</h4>
Every shield has a +1 modifier to armor class, but the size of
the shield determines how many opponent’s the +1 modifier
applies against. Small shields only offer the adjustment against
one attacker, medium shields against two attackers and large
shields against three attackers.

<h4>Dexterity</h4>
Dexterity modifies a character’s armor class if that character
can physically react to an attack. Characters lose their dexterity
modifier when they are surprised, unaware of an attacker or
when they are restrained or otherwise rendered immobile.
Dexterity does not apply, for example, when a character is
attacked from the rear.

<h4>Cover</h4>
Characters will often take cover behind objects such as tables,
doors, chairs or other structures in order to gain some protection.
Cover confers an armor class bonus to the character as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>COVER</th>
    <th>AC ADJUSTMENT</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/4 cover</td>
    <td>+2 AC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/2 cover</td>
    <td>+4 AC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/4 cover</td>
    <td>+6 AC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full cover</td>
    <td>+10 AC</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Although cover is primarily used as protection against missile
or ranged weapons, it can also be used in melee combat. For
example, when the wizard Anaximorus finds her spells useless
against a golem, she decides to jump behind a large column in
an attempt to avoid being smashed by its massive fists. This
action offers 3/4 cover from the golem’s attacks. When cover
is used in melee attacks though, the cover applies to both the
attacker and defender until one or the other move out from
behind it. In some cases, the Castle Keeper may rule that the
character seeking cover may not attack.


<h4>Magic</h4>
There are numerous other modifiers that can be applied to
armor class. Spells, magic armor and rings, or other unique
items and situations can increase or decrease armor class.
A character’s condition, such as being stunned poisoned, or
fatigued may affect the armor class. In general, magical rings,
robes or other protective devices and spells affect armor class
for touch attacks. Magical armors do not affect touch attacks.

<h4>Situational and Circumstance</h4>
There are innumerable situational modifiers which can also
adjust armor class. These are too numerous to list, but the
Castle Keeper should always bear in mind the current situation
or circumstances. For example, a rusted suit of armor may
suffer a -1 to its overall armor class adjustment. It is, as always,
incumbent on the Castle Keeper to use common sense when
making these adjustment. Always err on the side of safety. It is
a game, after all.

<h3 id="combat_maneuvers">Combat Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Players try all manner of inventive actions during combat,
from using chairs as shields, trying to dodge opponent’s blows
or running haphazardly away from some monstrous beast. It is
impossible to enumerate and describe all the possibilities and
it is unproductive to try and do so. These generally fall into a
category of combat maneuvers.</p>

<p>Some of the more common combat maneuvers and their
effects are listed and described below. These rules can be
considered optional as they are not necessary to gameplay.
They are provided to allow the Castle Keeper and players
more options in combat and to introduce the concept of
amending and adding rules to fit a group’s style of play. They
should be introduced slowly and with practice to insure that
they meld with the style and tempo of play desired by both
the players and Castle Keeper.
</p>


<h4 id="dodge">Dodge</h4>
In this case, a character can dodge up to three attacks in a round
that originate from an attacker(s) which they are facing and are
aware of. If dodging, the character sacrifices their action in that
round. They do not need to roll initiative, but must announce
their intention before the round begins. The character cannot
attack, cast spells, move or use an ability or item. The character
gains a +2 to their armor class while dodging. A character can
dodge every round should they desire.

<h4 id="disengaging_from_combat">Disengaging from Combat</h4>

Disengaging from combat is a dangerous maneuver since it
exposes the character to attacks, but it automatically puts
distance between the disengaging party and their opponent. The
player must announce that he is disengaging at the beginning of
the round. The disengaging character does not roll initiative. If
disengaging a character can take no other action. The character
is allowed a movement as defined below. Player characters,
monsters and non-player characters can disengage from combat.

<p><b>Hasty Disengagement:</b>  is one in which the character or monster
attempts to leave combat and expends all effort to do so. A
character disengaging hastily may move as far as possible up to
their maximum running distance, but they suffer a -2 to armor
class and their opponent gets an attack against them as they
run away. This is a free attack and does not count against the
opponent’s other action in the round, although the opponent
may not make a second attack against the fleeing character. The
armor class adjustment lasts throughout the combat round and
applies to every attack against the fleeing character.
</p>


<p> <b>Fighting Disengagement:</b> is a more carefully executed
withdrawal from combat. By performing a fighting
disengagement, the character moves one-half their movement
rate or less away from their opponent and they can disengage
from combat. The character suffers no penalty to armor class,
but they cannot take any other action in the round.
In the round following the disengagement the character
or monster has put distance between theirselves and their
opponent. </p>


<h4 id="disarm">Disarm</h4>

A fighter, ranger, knight, rogue, assassin, cleric and paladin can
disarm an opponent. The character must successfully hit an
armor class equivalent of 18 plus the hit dice or level of the
defender to successfully disarm them. For example, a ranger
would need to hit an armor class of 23 to disarm a 5 hit dice
creature or 5th level opponent. The defender receives a dexterity
bonus to this armor class, if applicable.

<h4 id="evade">Evade</h4>
This maneuver is a desperate attempt to avoid being hit and
involves using all one’s energies to dodge and parry blows but
remain engaged in combat. If evading the character sacrifices
their action in that round. They do not need to roll initiative,
but must announce their intention before the round begins.
The character cannot attack, cast spells, move or use an ability
or item. The character doing this is allowed to evade one
opponent they are facing. Evade confers a +4 bonus to armor
class for that round.

<h4 id="flank_attack">Flank Attack</h4>
The flank attack takes place to the left or right rear side of a
defender. Flank attacks should be used consistently for monsters
and characters alike. The defender may or may not be aware of
the attack, but in any case, is less capable of defending against
the flank attack than those from the front. A flank attack
confers a +1 bonus to hit.

<h4 id="rear_attack">Rear Attack</h4>
An attack to the rear of an opponent gives the attacker a +2
bonus to hit. The rogue and assassin do not get this in addition
to their back attack bonus, as it is already considered in their
class abilities.

<h4 id="twf">Two Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>At some point, characters will attempt to fight with a weapon in
both hands. This is a difficult skill to master, and it takes much
experience to do it well (see the monk class). When using two
weapons, the player must designate which hand is used for the
primary attack and which is the off hand attack. Typically, this
is determined by the handedness of the character, either right
handed or left handed.</p>
<p>The character is allowed to swing with both weapons, thus
gaining two attacks in a single round, but the attack with the
primary hand is at -3 and the attack with the off hand is at
-6. These penalties are affected by the character’s dexterity
modifier. The character’s strength modifier only applies to
damage inflicted.</p>

<p>A monk may use the two-weapon fighting rule to gain a second
hand-to-hand attack before the character reaches 6th level. If the
monk does so, both attacks suffer the penalties for two-weapon
fighting and the secondary attack inflicts normal fist damage of
1d2 hit points. When a monk reaches 6th level, the character
gains a secondary hand-to-hand attack. A monk’s secondary
hand-to-hand attack ability does not suffer any penalty for twoweapon
fighting and it inflicts the damage in the monk special
ability chart. But, if a monk at any level fights with a weapon in
one hand and attacks with his other hand, whether a primary
or secondary attack, the monk suffers the standard penalties
for two-weapon fighting and follows the preceding rules in this
paragraph as to secondary attack damage.</p>

<h4 id="hp">Hit Points</h4>
Hit points represent the amount of damage, physical and
mental, a character, non-player character or monster can take
before passing out or dying. A character’s hit points are a mere
abstraction and are not a numeration of the character’s physical
being. It is generally a representation of the overall health of the
individual. The higher the hit points, the healthier the individual.
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Hit points for the classes are acquired by level. At each level,
the hit die type is rolled and added to the previous level’s total.
The constitution modifier is added or subtracted from this
roll. At 10th level and above, all classes acquire hit points at a
specified rate. Constitution modifiers are added to or subtracted
from this. In all cases, a character gains at least 1 hit point for
each level advanced.</p>
<p>Hit points can be reduced by weapons, magical spells,
exhaustion, and poisons, amongst other things. These are
detailed in the following section. Once damage is taken, it must
be healed for the hit points to be restored to their maximum
level. Hit points can never be healed beyond what they were
before taking damage.</p>
<p>In general, hit points heal at a rate of one point per day and only
if the character is resting, well fed, kept warm and the wounds
being tended to. After seven days, the rate of healing increases
to include the constitution bonus, if any. After 14 days, the
rate of healing doubles and after thirty days, it triples. Rates of
healing can be adjusted by magical healing, herbs, diet, level of
care or other factors the Castle Keeper deems applicable.</p>
<p>In general, when 0 hit points is reached, the character or monster
passes out. They are not dead, but rather incapable of acting
while passed out due to blood loss and physical or mental damage.
The character or monster is unable to act and is unconscious or
gravely wounded. Those so wounded, if still conscious, can do
little more than crawl from the battlefield or call out for help.
Those with 0 hit points recover consciousness in 1d6 hours,
after which they can move at ½ their normal move rate, but still
cannot participate in combat, cast spells, turn undead or any
strenuous or demanding action. The full effect of magical healing
of characters reduced to 0 hit points is immediate.</p>

<p> <b>At -1 to -6 hit points,</b> the character or monster is unconscious
and grievously wounded. They require bed rest to recover.
Unless magically healed a character so wounded must rest 24
hours before the process of healing begins. With most magical
healing, the character’s hit points can only be returned to 0,
after which healing proceeds normally.
For example, a knight is struck by a club from an ettin and
reduced to -1 hit points. Before healing begins, the knight must
wait 24 hours. However, a cleric of goodly intent decides to
share the grace of their deity with the knight and cast a cure
light wounds on the knight. The cure is for 8 hit points, but the
knight is only brought back up to 0 hit points. However, healing
can proceed as normal thereafter. </p>

<p> <b>At -7 to -9 hit points,</b> the character or monster is mortally
wounded and loses one hit point per round after reaching -7 hit
points. Aid administered to the wounds stops the hit point loss.
This takes at least one full round, during which no hit point is
lost. After 24 hours have passed, the normal healing process as
described for -1 to -6 hit points begins. </p>

<p> <b>At -10 hit points death occurs immediately.</b> Only resurrection,
reincarnation or bribes to the Castle Keeper can remedy death. </p>


<h3 id="damage">Damage</h3>
If a hit is successful, damage is assessed for the opponent and
its hit points are reduced. Damage delivered from a blow by
a weapon depends on the weapon being used or as described
in the monsters description. Damage is applied immediately.
If a character or monster dies as a result of damage inflicted,
it gets no opportunity to swing, cast spells or anything else.
There are several categories of damage that need examining.
From this, the Castle Keeper should determine the type
and nature of any damage inflicted on a character if not
specifically described in the rules.
<p>Damage takes its toll in a variety of ways. A sword cutting an
arm, a mace crashing into a shield and bruising an arm or simply
physical exertion during the course of a difficult or long combat.
The Castle Keeper should not automatically assume that damage
causes flesh to be shorn from limbs and bones crushed. Four
points of damage to a 3rd level fighter could simply be bruising on
the arm, a series of small cuts or exertion. Alternately, it could
be a mortal blow that fells a character. In general, it is not wise
to break bones, lop off limbs or inflict significant organ damage,
as healing times for these types of wounds are significant and
complete recovery often impossible. Being creative with the type
of damage inflicted should enhance combat rather than detract
from game play. Be sure to keep it that way.</p>

<h4>Weapon Damage</h4>
The amount of damage inflicted is determined by the type of
weapon being used or natural weapons such as the claws of a
lion, the fist of a golem or the beak of a hippogriff. Weapon
damages are listed in the equipment chart. Damage from melee
weapons is adjusted by the strength modifier, magical weapon
bonuses, and other factors or adjustments if applicable. Natural
weapons and their effects are described in the appropriate
monster description or combat rule. Any modifications to
damage are noted in the descriptions.

<h4>Magic Damage</h4>
Damage caused by spell effects are applied in the same manner
as those by melee weapons or natural weapons. Special
considerations are described in the appropriate spell. Of special
note though, damage caused by illusions can be real. Though
not real in a material sense, the viewer of the illusion believes
the damage to be real and suffers psychic and mental shock as
if it were real. The spell descriptions list the details of damage
from illusions, but in general, it can be said that damage
received from illusory attacks is, in reality, subdual damage and
the characters follow all the rules for subdual damage with the
following exception. Characters or monsters reduced to -10
hit points by illusory damage die from the psychic shock to the
system, which is too great to withstand.


<h4>Subdual Damage</h4>
<p>This type of damage is generally not fatal, though on occasion
it can be. Subdual damage is more the bludgeoning one
receives in a fist fight than the slashing, gashing bone breaking
combat of swords and maces. It may hurt and even knock one
unconscious, but rarely draws blood and usually results in
damage that heals quickly.</p>
<p>Subdual damage is usually caused in unarmed combat with
natural weapons. However, many monsters use natural
weapons that cause normal damage. If a monster’s attack
causes subdual rather than normal damage, the monster
description will note it. Otherwise, damage from monsters
should be considered normal damage. A monk’s unarmed
attack is normal damage, unless the monk chooses to subdue
as if using a weapon.</p>
<p>An attacker can use weapons to deliver subdual damage but it
does so at varying rates. When being used for subdual, weapons
inflict normal damage, but it is mostly temporary damage.
Minimally, these weapons deliver one point of damage. All
subdual damage delivers some normal damage. For every five
points of subdual damage inflicted, one point is considered
normal damage.</p>
<p>Subdual damage heals faster than normal damage as it is
not usually fatal. It heals at a rate of 1 hit point per every
10 minutes. The normal damage inflicted as a part of subdual
damage heals as previously described. At the Castle Keeper’s
discretion, when a character reaches -10 hit points or more of
subdual damage, they have taken severe enough bludgeoning
damage to an internal organ to cause death or permanent
incapacitation. Otherwise, they should be considered
unconscious for 24 hours and do not begin healing until
gaining consciousness.</p>

<h4>Falling Damage</h4>
<p>Falling damage occurs when a character or monster falls from
a height of five feet or more. Falling can be very deadly and
players should be made aware of the potential hazards of a fall
prior to beginning a climb.</p>

<p>If a character falls from a height of six to ten feet, a dexterity
check must be made. If the check is successful, the person
falling takes no damage. If the check is not successful, the
person takes 1d6 points of damage. From heights greater
than ten feet, damage accrues significantly. For every ten
feet fallen, the number of d6 used for damage increases by
one. The damage for each 10 feet fallen is cumulative. For
example, if a character falls 18 feet, they take 1d6 damage
for the first ten feet and 2d6 damage for the next 10 feet for
a total of 3d6 damage. If a charcter were to fall from a height
of 45 feet, they would take 1d6 damage for the first 10 feet,
2d6 damage for the second 10 feet, 3d6 damage for the third
10 feet, and 4d6 damage for the last 10 feet, for a total 10d6
points of damage.</p>
