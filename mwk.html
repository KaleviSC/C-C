<h3>Expert Weapons and Armor</h3>

Skilled blacksmiths are able to create exceptional weapons and
armor. These items are rare and expensive. Crafting them is time
consuming, requiring a master blacksmith who usually must
employ a number of journeymen smiths and use finely tempered
metals. For these reasons expert items cost ten times that of a
normal item. They are almost never found for sale in a merchantâ€™s
shop and must be specially ordered. Expert weapons and armor
are not magical in nature but are so finely crafted that they can
grant the possessor a bonus in damage, attack or armor class.

<h4>Weapons</h4>
Expert weapons include a variety of well crafted items: swords
with razor sharp edges, keenly balanced arrows, axes with
weighted heads that cleave armor and bone, spears with extra
points etc. These items gain a +1 to hit or a +1 to damage
bonus. These expert weapons cost 10 times the amount of a
normal item. In some rare instances weapons are so crafted that
they gain a +1 to damage and a +1 to hit bonus, however these
items cost 25 times the amount of a normal item. These are called
greater expert weapons. For example, an expert longsword that
gains a +1 damage bonus, or a +1 to hit, would cost 150gp. A
greater expert longsword that gains a +1 to damage and +1 to
hit bonus would cost 375gp.

<h4>Armor</h4>
Expert armors include: balanced shields, personalized suits of
armor, mail hauberks with tightened rings, etc. These items give
the wearer a +1 bonus to their AC. Such an item costs 10 times
the amount of a normal item. In some instances armor is so well
crafted that it can absorb one point of damage from a single
blow. These greater expert armors cost 25 times a normal item.
