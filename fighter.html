<h5 id="fighter_weapon_specialization">WEAPON SPECIALIZATION</h5>
At 1st level, the fighter can
choose one weapon with which to specialize. All weapons are
eligible, including ranged weapons such as the bow or sling. The
weapon with which the fighter specializes is usually common to
the fighterâ€™s culture or society, but it need not be. The Castle
Keeper and player should consult to determine which weapons
are available for specialization, bearing in mind culture, location
and availability.
<p>The fighter can only choose one weapon with which to
specialize. Once chosen, the weapon cannot be changed. For
fighters between 1st and 6th level, this specialization imparts a
+1 bonus to hit and a +1 bonus to damage when being used.
At 7th level and above, the bonuses increase to a +2 to hit and
+2 to damage.</p>

<h5 id="fighter_combat_dominance">COMBAT DOMINANCE</h5>

At 4th level, the fighter gains an
extra attack with any weapon when fighting opponents with
<a style="color:red;">3 hit dice less than the fighter or less</a>. In order to use this ability, the fighter must
direct all attacks in a combat round against opponents that
meet these criteria. The fighter can split the available attacks
among qualified opponents as desired. This ability improves as
the fighter progresses in levels. The fighter gains an additional
attack for every four levels gained after 4th level. So, at 8th level,
the fighter is allowed a total of three attacks, and at 12th level,
the fighter gains four attacks against these opponents. This
ability does not combine with the Extra Attack ability described
below. This ability is only useable with melee weapons and
cannot be applied to ranged combat.

<h5 id="fighter_extra_attack">EXTRA ATTACK</h5>

At 10th level, the fighter gains one
additional attack each combat round with any weapon. This
ability does not combine with Combat Dominance. When in
a combat where both abilities could be used, the player must
choose to use either the Extra Attack or Combat Dominance
ability during each round. The Extra Attack ability is useable
with melee and ranged weapons.
