<h3>ENHANCED SENSES</h3>
Elvish physiology is blessed with
enhanced vision and hearing. Elves can see farther than
humans in just about every circumstance, including
torchlight, and can see clearly enough to read a road
sign or spot a shield device up to two miles distant
when outside during the day. They can also hear very
well, and receive a +2 bonus to all checks involving
listening.

<h3>TWILIGHT VISION</h3>
Even under starlight, moonlight or torchlight, elves have exceedingly good
vision. They can distinguish color and detail under
these conditions for up to one mile but only if they
are outside.

<h3>SPELL RESISTANCE (WISDOM)</h3>
Elves
are particularly resistant to spells and spelllike
abilities that charm or unnaturally cause sleep. When
making saving throws against these types of spells, an elf receives
a +10 bonus. Elf spell resistance allows a saving throw against
sleep, even though sleep normally does not have a saving throw.

<h3>SPOT HIDDEN DOORS (WISDOM)</h3>
Elvish vision and keen
senses allow them to spot secret, hidden and concealed doorways.
An elf merely passing within 5 feet of a secret, hidden or concealed
doorway is entitled to a wisdom check to spot the door, as if the
elf were actively looking for it. When an elf actively searches for
such doorways, the bonus to the wisdom check is +2.

<h3>WEAPON TRAINING</h3>
Elves are taught the ways of combat at
a young age, and their long lives allow them to become skilled in
weapons favored by their society. Elves begin play with a +1 bonus
to hit with one of the following weapons: composite longbow,
composite shortbow, longbow, shortbow, longsword or shortsword.
