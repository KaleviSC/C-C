        <h5 id="druid_bonus_languages">BONUS LANGUAGES</h5>
Druids have a secret language used for communicating
with one another. They are forbidden from
teaching this language to any but their
brethren.

<p>Additionally, if a druid has a high enough
intelligence to learn an additional
language, the following languages
are available to them: aquan, auran,
elf, fey, giant, gnome, sylvan and terran.
The druid must have lived in or near a
community of those whose language they
seek to learn.</p>

<h5 id="druid_nature_lore">NATURE LORE (WISDOM)</h5>
Druids are connected to the forces of nature. They mystically coexist with their
environment, gradually becoming a larger part of it. This
relationship imparts to them a specialized knowledge of the
wilds. A druid can identify plants and animals with perfect
accuracy in the type of environment where the druid was
trained or currently lives. In unfamiliar environments, the
druid must succeed at a wisdom check to successfully use
this ability.
<p>This identification ability allows the druid to determine
the species of a plant or animal and the special qualities or
abilities of the species. The druid can also determine whether
water is safe or dangerous to drink. Additionally, druids can
find shelter and forage for food. A druid always succeeds in
finding basic shelter and enough food for individual daily
sustenance. If the druid wishes to support additional people,
they must spend 6 hours hunting and gathering to produce
enough food and water to feed 2-8 people for a day. If the
druid wishes to feed or shelter a larger group of people than
the die indicate, a successful wisdom check is necessary.
If successful, the druid must spend an additional 6 hours
gathering food to feed and water an additional 2-8 people. A
third attempt to gather food can be made. A wisdom check
at -4 is made but if successful, another 6 hours of searching
can feed an additional 1-4 people. This additional effort
allows the druid to gather food and water for up to 5-20
creatures total. The druid can only hunt and forage for food
three times per day.</p>

<h5 id="druid_spells">SPELLS</h5>
A druid casts divine spells. The spells available are
listed on the druid spell list. Each druid can cast a limited
number of spells from each spell level per day. The Cleric and
Druid Spells Per Day Table (pg 28) shows the number of spells
per day a druid may cast for each spell level. Druids prepare and
cast spells by praying for them. This process is covered in greater
detail in the Magic section.

<h6>BONUS SPELLS</h6>
High wisdom indicates a greater divine connection or spiritual connection.
Druids with a high wisdom gain bonus spells.
If they have a wisdom modifier of +1 or higher they recieve an extra 1st level spell.
  If the wisdom modifier is +2 or higher, they recieve an extra second level spell and so on.
  Bonus spells can only be aquired if the cleric is at a high enough level to cast them. Bonus spells are cumulative.

  <h5 id="druid_resist_elements">RESIST ELEMENTS</h5>
  At 2nd level, druids gain a +2 bonus to
  saving throws against fire, water, earth, air, cold and lightning
  attacks.

    <h5 id="druid_woodland_stride">WOODLAND STRIDE</h5>
    At 3rd level, druids gain the ability
    to move through natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas
    and similar terrain at normal speed and without suffering
    damage or other impairment. When doing so, druids leave
    no trail in the natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.
    However, thorns, briars and overgrown areas that are
    enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect druids.


    <h5 id="druid_totem_shape">TOTEM SHAPE</h5>
  <p> At 6th level, druids gain the spell-like ability
    to change into a small or medium-size animal and back again
    once per day. This ability operates like the spell polymorph
    self. Upon attaining this ability, a druid must choose a totem
    shape. The selection is permanent, and cannot be changed.
    Each time a druid uses this ability, the character regains 1d4
    hit points.</p>
    <p>    At 7th and 8th levels, the druid gains a new totem shape. Each
        shape can be assumed once per day. At 12th level, the druid
        gains the ability to take the shape of a large version of one of the
        previously chosen totem forms. This large form can be assumed
        once per day, and the druid can decide between the three forms
        each time this ability is used. When assuming the large version
        of a totem form, the druid heals 5d8 hit points. At 15th level,
        the druid can take a totem shape twice per day and at 18th level,
        three times per day.</p>
