<h3>INNATE MAGIC</h3>
Yordles have an innate ability to cast spells. These innate spells are in addition to
any spells available to yordles of spellcasting character classes.
Yordles can cast once per day as a 1st level caster
two selected 0th level spells and one first level spell from any spell list.
They must be from the same spell list.
Yordles cannot change the spells once they are selected.

<h3>GENDERBASED ENHANCED SENSES</h3>
Male Yordles can hear very well, and receive a +2
bonus to all checks involving listening. Female Yordles recieve a +2 bonus to
all checks involving spotting checks.

<h3>DARKVISION </h3>
In a similar manner to dwarves, Yordles can
see in complete darkness for up to 60 feet. Darkvision produces
images that are in shades of gray, but it is otherwise like normal
sight. Yordles can function well with no light at all. Bright lights,
such as from a lantern or other light source, spoil darkvision. A
gnome requires one minute to adjust his or her eyes when a light
source is extinguished before gaining full use of darkvision.
