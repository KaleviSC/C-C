<h3>Attribute Modifiers</h3>
<i>Optional Rule CKG</i>

<p>Attributes, if they are high or low enough, provide the character
with an attribute modifier. This modifier is a number added to
or subtracted from attribute checks, saving throws, to-hit rolls,
damage, etc. As noted in the Players Handbook, each attribute
has a modifier assigned to it. The modifiers are as follows:</p>
<br>
<br>
<table class="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Score</th>
    <th>Attribute Modifier</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">1</td>
<td style="text-align:center">−5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">2–3</td>
<td style="text-align:center">−4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">4–5</td>
<td style="text-align:center">−3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">6–7</td>
<td style="text-align:center">−2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">8–9</td>
<td style="text-align:center">−1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">10–11</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">12–13</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">14–15</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">16–17</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">18–19</td>
<td style="text-align:center">+4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">20–21</td>

<h3>The Six Attributes</h3>

Attributes represent a character’s physical and mental traits.
All characters in Castles & Crusades have six attributes:
<br>

<li>STRENGTH (STR)</li>
<li> INTELLIGENCE (INT)</li>
<li>DEXTERITY (DEX) </li>
<li>WISDOM (WIS)</li>
<li>CONSTITUTION (CON)</li>
<li> CHARISMA (CHA)</li>


<p>Each attribute has a numeric score. Each
attribute score also has a corresponding modifier, which is a
bonus or penalty added to or subtracted from certain die rolls
during the game as detailed throughout the rules.</p>

<p>There are two types of attributes: primary and secondary. Of the
six attributes each character has, the player selects a few to be
primary attributes. The remaining attributes are secondary. The
distinction is important when determining the outcome of many
actions in Castles & Crusades. When a character uses a class
ability, such as a rogue attempting to pick a fat giant’s pocket or
a ranger tracking a brigand through a dark forest, an attribute
check is rolled to determine if the action is successful. Each
class ability has an attribute check associated with it. If the class
ability’s associated attribute is one of the character’s primary
attributes, the character has a greater chance of successfully
performing the task. The same principle holds true for the other
aspects of the game in which an attribute check is required.
Attribute checks are explained in greater detail later (see The
Castle Keeper and the Game - Attributes and the Game). For now,
just remember that the selection of primary and secondary
attributes significantly affects the possibility of success for many
actions in the game. Attribute checks associated with a primary
attribute are significantly more likely to succeed than those
actions performed with a secondary attribute.</p>

<p> <b>STRENGTH:</b> This attribute reflects physical strength,
including the ability to lift or move heavy objects and make
powerful attacks. The modifier affects melee combat and
damage, and all checks involving strength. Characters can
military press 10 times their strength and dead lift 15 times
their strength score.</p>

<p> <b>DEXTERITY:</b> This attribute represents a character’s reflexes,
manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination, including the
ability to dodge and defend against attacks. The modifier
affects armor class, ranged combat and all checks involving
dexterity.</p>
<p> <b>CONSTITUTION:</b> This attribute reflects overall health,
and also represents a character’s ability to withstand pain,
suffer physical damage, avoid fatigue and fight off sickness
or poison. The modifier affects hit points, and it applies to all
checks involving constitution. </p>
<p> <b>INTELLIGENCE:</b> This attribute reflects mental aptitude.
It represents a character’s ability to learn quickly, apply
that learning effectively and use deductive reasoning. The
modifier affects the number of arcane spells a character can
cast each day, the number of languages a character can learn
and all checks involving intelligence.</p>
<p> <b>WISDOM:</b> This attribute reflects depth of personal experience,
the ability to make well-considered decisions or judgments,
and represents a spiritual connection to a deity. The modifier
affects the number of divine spells that can be cast each day,
attempts to turn the undead and all checks involving wisdom.</p>
<p> <b>CHARISMA:</b> This attribute represents strength of
attractiveness, willpower, personality, and leadership. It is
the degree to which a character is able to influence others.
The modifier affects a creature’s loyalty and reactions to the
character, the number of undead the character can turn and
all checks involving charisma.</p>
