<h3>ANIMOSITY (ELVES)</h3>
The disparate personalities of dwarves
and elves have resulted in eons of misunderstandings, squabbles
and even wars between the two races. Dwarves consider elves
to be disloyal and untrustworthy partners in war or trade. As
a result, dwarves suffer a -2 penalty to charisma checks when
dealing with elves to whom they are not closely associated.

<h3>DEEPVISION</h3>
Ages spent beneath the earth in the dark and
quiet places of the world have imbued dwarves with the ability
to see in darkness where a human would find it impenetrable.
This vision extends up to 120 feet in even the darkest of nights
and deepest of tunnels. Colors tend to erode with deepvision,
and objects appear in many shades of gray. It is otherwise like
normal sight, and dwarves can function well with no light at all.
Bright lights, such as from a lantern or other light source, spoil
deepvision. A dwarf requires one minute to adjust his or her
eyes when a light source is extinguished before gaining full use
of deepvision.

<h3>DETERMINE DEPTH AND DIRECTION</h3>
The world
beneath mountains and in the deeps of the earth is the natural
home of the dwarf. Dwarves can sense their approximate depth
underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
The dwarf can determine direction underground just as easily.

<h3>ENMITY (GOBLINS/ORCS)</h3>
Eternal wars against goblins
and orcs have created an undying crucible of hatred for
these vile creatures. When in combat against goblins or
orcs, this fury and hatred allows dwarves a +1 bonus to hit
these creatures. Dwarves have a similar distrust of half-orcs.
Dwarves find inter-breeding with goblinoids to be the worst of
all sins, and their powerful antipathy towards pure goblinoids
negatively affects dwarven relations with half-orcs. Dwarves
suffer a -4 to charisma checks when interacting with half-orcs,
goblins and orcs.

<h3>DEFENSIVE EXPERTISE (GIANTS/OGRES)</h3>
Long regarded as a food source by many giants, dwarves have
developed considerable expertise in fighting them. Combined
with their small size, this tactical expertise allows dwarves to
offer resistance to the powerful giants. When fighting giants or
ogres, dwarves receive a +4 bonus to armor class.

<h3>RESISTANT TO ARCANE MAGIC</h3>
As unshakeable as
granite or iron, dwarves are particularly resistant to arcane
magic. They receive a +3 bonus to all saving throws against
arcane spells and spell-like effects.

<h3>RESISTANT TO FEAR</h3>
Dwarven loyalty, duty, stubbornness
and honor lend them courage where other races might falter.
Dwarves receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws against fear.

<h3>RESISTANT TO POISONS (CONSTITUTION)</h3>
Dwarves are
imbued with great constitutional fortitude. Poisons that might
fell a normal human are less likely to affect a dwarf. Dwarves
receive a +2 bonus to all poison saving throws.

<h3>STONECRAFT (WISDOM)</h3>
Dwarves spend much of their lives
carving halls, castles and underground fortresses out of solid
rock, so they possess an extensive knowledge of stoneworking
and construction. They possess almost a sixth sense in this
regard which gives them various bonuses and abilities.
<p>Dwarves are capable of spotting unusual or unique construction
or stonework features including new construction, unfamiliar
architecture, sliding walls, stonework traps, unsafe stone
surfaces, unstable ceilings and secret or concealed doorways
constructed or disguised as stone. A dwarf passing within 10
feet of one of these features is entitled to a wisdom check at
+2 to recognize the feature, as if actively looking for it. Should
a dwarf actively search for these features, the bonus to the
wisdom check is +4. When examining a feature, a successful
wisdom check reveals other bits of knowledge, such as which
race created the feature, its approximate age, and if applicable,
the approximate value of a stone or metal object.</p>
