<h3>Bloodhound</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-orc, Wisdom 13

<p>Some half-orcsâ€™ sense of smell is so keen they can use it to track.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Half-orcs who select this advantage can attempt to
track prey by scent by making a wisdom attribute check.

<br><br>

<h3>Fierce Warrior</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-Orc, BtH +1

<p>Due to their violent upbringing, some half-orcs are skilled at
dealing damage quickly with reckless blows in fierce combat.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> A half-orc can increase the intensity and fierceness of
attacks gaining a +2 to damage with a successful hit, but the
recklessness of their attack incurs a -2 penalty on their armor
class until their next action.

<br><br>

<h3>Intimidating Presence</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-Orc, BtH +1

<p>Some half-orcs radiate an aura of menace that unnerves
opponents in single combat against them.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> A half-orc who chooses this advantage intimidates foes
that face them one on one in combat. Such a foe suffers a -1
penalty to all attack rolls. However, this intimidating presence
puts others off in non-combat situations and half-orcs who
select it suffer a -1 penalty on all reactions.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The reaction penalties for this and prominent tusks
both apply if the character chooses both advantages.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Prominent Tusks</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-Orc

<p>Some half-orcs retain the prominent tusks of their Orcish
forbears, allowing them to bite and gore.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Half-orcs who select this advantage can make an
unarmed bite attack at their normal BtH in place of an attack
with a weapon. The damage for such an attack is 1d4. However,
their more bestial appearance incurs a -1 penalty on all reactions.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The reaction penalties for this and intimidating
presence both apply if the character chooses both advantages. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Rock-Gut</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-Orc

<p>Because many half-orcs have to scrounge and forage to survive
while growing up, they are able to stomach fare that would leave
others sick and heaving and can endure toxins in their system.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Half-orcs who select this advantage gain a +1 bonus
to all constitution saving throws against poison and avoiding
illness caused by spoiled foods or tainted liquids.

<br><br>

<h3>Stone-Cold Killer</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-Orc, BtH +2

<p>Half-orcs learn quickly it is a kill or be killed world, so develop
a killer instinct and learn to take advantage of a surprised foe to
dispatch them quickly.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Half-orcs who select this advantage receive a +2 to
damage on attacks against a surprised foe.
