  </p>


<br><br>


<h3>Adept Summoner</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> The ability to cast a summoning spell

<p>The character’s ability to summon other creatures is more
powerful than other spellcasters.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Study and practice in the art of summoning other
creatures to serve the characters allows the character to summon
more powerful creatures or a larger number of creatures. The
caster level is considered to be 2 levels higher when used to
calculate the maximum number of HD worth of creatures they
normally can summon and control.

<br><br>

<h3>Apprentice's Bolt</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> 1st level Wizard or Illusionist

<p>Low-level wizards and illusionists harness latent magical power
to attack enemies.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b>The wizard or illusionist may use a bolt of arcane power to strike
at their enemies. The bolt can be fired once per round, has a 30
ft. range, requires a ranged touch attack to hit, and strikes for
1d2 points of force damage, +1 point per/2levels.

<p> <b>Example:</b> Cascalian the 20th level illusionist is trapped in the
wilderness without any spells or access to her spellbook. She
may cast an apprentice’s bolt at her orc attackers once per
round for 1d2+10 points of force damage to defend herself.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Blessed Healer</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Cleric, ability to Turn Undead

<p>The character’s deity grants them great powers of healing, but
at a cost.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Through deep prayer and consultation with their
god, the character has traded their ability to turn undead for
the ability to convert their prepared spells into curative spells.
After acquiring this advantage the character can no longer turn
undead. Instead, they can spend one round praying to their
god to convert a prepared spell into a healing spell of any sort.
Healing spells include all cure spells, remove disease, remove
curse, and similar spells. This does NOT include spells such
as raise dead or resurrection because the target of these spells is
already dead.

<br><br>

<h3>Greater Protector</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> The ability to cast spells

<p>The character believes the best defense is a good defense!</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> An intense focus on protective spells and magic has
increased the character’s ability to use protective magic in an
effective, and long-lasting manner. While casting a protective
spell such as bless, aid, barkskin, mage armor, or the like, their
spell is treated as if it were cast by a caster 2 levels higher for
purposes of strength and duration.

<br><br>

<h3>Hardy Caster</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> The ability to cast spells

<p>The character has great concentration, even when wounded.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The character’s focus on magic makes them difficult
to distract, even physical pain can’t keep them from completing
their spell. They receive a +3 bonus on concentration checks
to avoid spell disruption due to physical damage.

<br><br>

<h3>Holy Aura</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Cleric, the ability to Turn Undead, BtH +2

<p>The character has a visual conduit of their deity.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Through deep prayer and communion with their god,
the character permanently trades the ability to turn undead for
the ability to invoke a holy aura. When they hold forth their holy
symbol and chant a loud prayer for one full round, their god cloaks
them in a faintly glowing aura that demonstrates their power and
grace. Enemies within 30 feet of the character must succeed at a
wisdom save or suffer a –1 penalty to their attack rolls. Maintaining
the aura requires constant prayer, which prevents spellcasting but
has no effect on the character’s ability to fight.

<br><br>

<h3>Magical Aptitude</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Able to cast wizard spells, Intelligence 15

<p>Some casters have a natural affinity to certain types of magical
spells. Spells of this type cast by them are more powerful.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When a wizard chooses one of the affinities below,
they cast them as if they were a wizard of 1 level higher
when determining random effects and when determining the
challenge level of saving throws against these spells.

<p> <b>Special:</b> A character can only choose 1 magical aptitude. When
this advantage is taken, select one of the aptitudes below:</p>

<li><b>Battle Mage:</b> when casting spells that deal hit point
damage to the target or targets, the character is caster
level +1.</li>
<li><b>Conjurer's Call:</b> when casting spells that summon or
bring forth a creature or being from another place or
plane, the character is caster level +1.</li>
<li><b>Death Touch:</b> When casting spells that sap ability
scores, kill, or deal with undead, the character is caster
level +1.</li>
<li><b>Elemental Affinity:</b> When casting spells that involve
one of the four elements (earth, air, fire, or water), the
character is caster level +1.</li>

<li><b>Enthralling Countenance:</b> When casting spells that
enchant, charm, or affect the mind, the character is
caster level +1.</li>
<li><b>Eyes of the Seer:</b> When casting all detection spells
and spells that reveal information to the caster, the
character is caster level +1.</li>
<li><b>Warder:</b> When casting protection spells or spells that
provide an AC bonus to the caster, the character is
caster level +1.</li>


<br><br>

<h3>Master of Light and Sound</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> The ability to cast 3rd level illusionist spells

<p>The character has focused their studies on illusion magic, to the
detriment of other magics.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The character has mastered the ability to shape light
and sound to create particularly convincing illusions. Their indepth
study of the control of light grants them the ability to
cast illusions as if they were one level higher with respect to
saving throws, strength, and duration. Unfortunately, this deep
focus makes all of their other spells less effective. All other spells
are cast as if they were one level lower with respect to strength
and duration (but not saving throws). This advantage does not
change the number of spells the caster can prepare, only how
effective, or ineffective, they are when they cast them.


<br><br>

<h3>Master of Shadows</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> The ability to cast shadow conjuration

<p>The character’s links to the Plane of Shadows strengthen their
spells.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The character controls the shadows, shaping and
fusing them into semi-real illusions that are more difficult to see
through and damage even those that do not believe in them.
When the caster casts shadow conjuration or shadow evocation
their spells do 40% damage to those that disbelieve them, and
they cast as if they were one level higher with respect to saving
throws. When they cast shades, the creatures they conjure have
80% of the normal hit points, and, if disbelieved, they have 80%
of the AC, strength, and abilities of their normal counterparts.

<p> <b>Special:</b>This advantage stacks with the high-level illusionist
ability solidify shadows. A spell cast by a high-level illusionist
with this advantage can do more than 100% normal damage. </p>


<br><br>

<h3>Quickcast</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Ability to cast 3rd level spells

<p>The character’s intensity allows them to cast spells more quickly.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Intense focus on your magical abilities allows you to
cast your spells more quickly than normal. When casting a spell
during a combat round, the character can choose to receive a
+4 bonus to their initiative check. The intense focus required
comes at a price, as they are limited to 5 feet of movement during
any round they use this advantage and suffer a –2 penalty to
their armor class for the rest of the round. This advantage can
only be used for spellcasting, the bonus to their initiative does
not apply to melee or ranged attacks or to movement. If they
take damage while using the quickcast advantage, they must
succeed at a concentration check (CL=5 + damage taken) to
avoid having the spell disrupted and losing it.


<h3>Signature Spells</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Able to cast spells, Intelligence or Wisdom 15+

<p>Some spells are so familiar to the character that they can cast
them without preparation.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Casters who select this advantage may select 1 spell
for each level of spell that they can cast, and cast this spell in
place of other spells of the same level that they have prepared or
selected for the day. For example, a cleric who chooses cure light
wounds as their signature spell for first level may cast cure light
wounds instead of another spell chosen for the day.

<p> <b>Special:</b> This advantage does not give the caster any additional
spells per day. Rather, it allows them to replace prepared spells
with their signature spell.</p>
