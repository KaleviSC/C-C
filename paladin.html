<h5 id="paladin_cure_disease">CURE DISEASE</h5>
At 1st level, the paladin can cure any disease,
no matter the origin, once per week. This ability improves as the
paladin rises in levels. At 6th level, the paladin can cure disease
two times per week, and at 12th level, three times per week.

<h5 id="paladin_detect_evil"> DETECT EVIL</h5>
Beginning at first level, paladins have the
ability to detect evil in the same manner as the spell. However,
this ability is innate and no spell casting is involved. A paladin
simply concentrates for one round on an area or individual
within 60 feet to use the ability. The paladin must face toward
the area or individual being examined. The paladin can do this
as often as desired, but must be able to concentrate for at least
one round to do so.

<h5 id="paladin_divine_aura">DIVINE AURA </h5>
Paladins emanate a permanent divine aura
that wards against attacks from evil, summoned or conjured
creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the paladin that
conveys a +2 bonus to armor class and a +2 bonus on all
saving throws against evil creatures. The divine aura also
prevents bodily contact by summoned or conjured creatures.
This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures
to fail, and the creatures to recoil, if such attacks require
touching the warded creature. Good elementals and outsiders
are immune to this effect.

<h5 id="paladin_divine_health">DIVINE HEALTH </h5>
The paladin is immune to all diseases, of
any origin.

<h5 id="paladin_lay_on_hands">LAY ON HANDS </h5>
A paladin can cure 2 hit points per level once
per day. This ability can be used on the paladin or on others, but
the healing cannot be divided among multiple recipients.

<h5 id="paladin_turn_undead">TURN UNDEAD (WISDOM) </h5>
At 3rd level, the paladin gains
the ability to turn undead as a cleric of 1st level. When making
a wisdom check to turn undead, a paladin adds his “turning
level” to the roll, not the character’s actual level. This ability
improves with each level, so a 5th level paladin turns undead
like a 3rd level cleric, etc.

<h5 id="paladin_divine_mount"> DIVINE MOUNT</h5>
At 4th level, the paladin gains the ability to
call a divine warhorse or other mount. A paladin’s deity confers
this grace upon the paladin as a reward for faithful service.
The divine mount is unusually intelligent, strong, loyal, and
ready to serve the paladin in his or her crusade against evil.
The mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a medium-sized
paladin) or a war pony (for a small-sized paladin). Should the
paladin’s mount die, a year and a day must pass before another
can be called. The Castle Keeper provides information about
the mount that responds to the paladin’s call.

<h5 id="paladin_aura_of_courage">AURA OF COURAGE</h5>
At 6th level, a paladin is immune to fear
(magical or otherwise). Allies within 10 feet of the paladin gain
a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.

<h5 id="paladin_smite_evil">SMITE EVIL</h5>
Once per day, a paladin of 9th level or higher
may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. Smite
evil adds the paladin’s charisma modifier (if positive) to the
attack roll, and deals 1 extra hit point of damage per level of
the paladin. It lasts for 1 round per level of the paladin. This
ability can be used once per day, and only on creatures of evil
alignment.

<h5 id="paladin_divine_healing"> DIVINE HEALING</h5>

At 12th level, a paladin can call upon his
deity to aid those in need of healing. Divine healing enables
the character to wipe away disease and injury. It completely
cures all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage and
all temporary ability damage. It neutralizes poisons in the
subject’s system, so that no additional damage or effects are
suffered. It dispels the effects of a feeblemind spell. It cures
those mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the
brain. Only a single application of the ability is needed to
simultaneously achieve all these effects. The ability does not
remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels
or restore permanently drained ability scores. The paladin
can use the ability once per week.
