<h2 style="text-align:center">Experience Points</h2>


After characters defeat monsters or acquire treasure, they earn
experience points (xp). The Castle Keeper is free to award
experience points in whatever manner desired, but the following
is a recommended general method.

<h3>Monsters</h3>
The Castle Keeper adds the value of all monsters
defeated or overcome on the adventure. Each monster has a
base xp value, and a bonus can be given if a specific monster was
greater than normal for its type. The total xp are then divided
by the number of characters that defeated the monsters.

<h3>Money</h3>
Although not all Castle Keepers do so, some award xp
for non-magical treasure. The Castle Keeper should award 1 xp
to the party for every 1gp value of non-magical treasure such as
money, gems, art and other items acquired during the adventure.

<h3>Magic Items</h3>
Like monsters, magic items have a xp value.
The Castle Keeper should award a magic item’s xp value to a
character who possesses and uses the item for a period of time.

<h3>Story</h3>
The Castle Keeper should assign an xp value to each
adventure and award that total to each character who completed
the adventure successfully. An easy way to determine the story
xp value is to compare the adventure to a monster of a hit dice
that is challenging to the party. The Castle Keeper can then
award xps as if the party overcame that monster.

<h3>Roleplaying</h3>
The Castle Keeper can also award specific
characters xp bonuses for good role playing (or penalties for
bad) in a specific situation or over the course of an adventure.
A good range to award is 25 to 250 xps, depending on the level
of the character.


<h2 style="text-align:center">Gaining Levels</h2>


Characters gain levels as they adventure. Gaining levels equates
to becoming better and more experienced at one’s chosen
profession. With new levels, the character gains more abilities
and greater chances of performing abilities successfully. Hit
points increase as does bonus to hit.

<p>To gain a level, the character must accumulate enough
experience points to meet the next level’s experience point
progression (EPPs). The EPPs for each class are located in the
appropriate class description. Experience points are gained by
successfully completing an adventure, killing foes, successfully
performing actions, collecting treasure and as rewards for good
role playing. The Castle Keeper awards experience points as
described in the rules but always has the right to add or subtract
experience points for whatever reason.</p>


<p>Monster experience points are located in Monsters & Treasure.
Experience points awarded for treasure acquired is equal to
the gold piece value of all the treasure picked up in the course
of adventuring. Optionally, the Castle Keeper may not allow
this or only some percentage of the treasure’s value, as this
may speed up the rate of level progression depending on the
amount of treasure acquired. For experience points awarded for
defeating monsters and role playing see Monsters and Treasure.
Bear in mind that the Castle Keeper does not have to award
this amount if the player did a poor job of role playing, but can
if he wants to.</p>


<p>Once enough experience points are acquired to advance a
level, the character must train for the number of weeks equal
to the level reached before receiving the benefits of that level.
For example, a 6th level cleric, upon acquiring the experience
points necessary to reach 7th level, must train for 7 weeks before
receiving the benefits of that level. Once training is completed,
the character gains the extra hit points, spells or abilities which
that level confers upon the class.</p>
