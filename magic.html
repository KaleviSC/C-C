<h3 id="preparing_spells">PREPARING SPELLS</h3>

Methods for preparing and casting spells is generally the same
for characters of all spellcasting classes. Spellcasters must
prepare their spells for casting on a daily basis and they utilize
roughly the same process to do so.


<h4 id="prepwizill">Wizards and Illusionists</h4>
Wizards and illusionists learn complex, arcane formulas to
harness magic and give it effect. Their spells are known as
arcane spells, and both classes inscribe them, in their own
unique language, in a spell book. Each wizard and illusionist
begins play possessing an arcane tome of spells containing
those spells they know how to prepare and cast. The number of
spells of each level in the book is equal to the number of spells
of that level the caster can prepare at one time (including
bonus spells). A wizard’s spell book is typically quite large in
size and thickness, averaging about four pages per spell. New
spells may be learned and added to spell books through gaining
a level, by copying from another spellbook or from scrolls and
through research.

<p>Each day, wizards and illusionists memorize and prepare the
spells they intend to cast during the day. A character’s level
limits the number of spells the character can prepare and
cast each day, although a high or low intelligence score might
grant bonus spells or take away from the typical number of
daily spells gained.</p>

      <p> A wizard or illusionist must have access to a spell book to study,
        and sufficient light to read in order to prepare the spells. A
        character can use a borrowed spell book or a spell book written
        by another magic-user to prepare a spell the character already
        knows and has recorded in the character’s own spell book, but
        read magic must first be cast in order to decipher the writing in
        the book (See Acquiring New Spells).</p>
      <p>A character needs to sleep and rest for a total of 8 hours each
        day before preparing spells. The character need not slumber for
        every minute of that time, but must refrain from movement,
        combat, spell-casting or any other fairly demanding physical
        or mental task during the rest period. If the character’s rest
        is interrupted, each interruption adds one hour to the total
        amount of time the character has to rest, in order to clear his
        or her mind. A character must have at least one hour of rest
        immediately prior to preparing spells for the day. If the character
        does not need to sleep for some reason, the character still must
        have eight hours of restful calm each day before preparing any
        spells. When the character prepares spells for the coming day,
        all spells the character has cast within the last eight hours count
        against the character’s daily limit of spells of a specific level.</p>
      <p>In addition to the complete hour of rest immediately prior to
        preparing spells for the day, it takes 15 minutes per spell for a
        character to study a spell book and memorize the spell for the
        day. A character need not prepare a full complement of spells
        allowed per day, but preparing even one spell takes at least one
        hour of rest and 15 minutes of study.</p>
        <p>To prepare any spell, the character must have enough peace,
        quiet and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The
        character’s surroundings must be free from overt distractions,
        such as nearby combat or other loud noises. Exposure to
        inclement weather might prevent the necessary concentration,
        as would any injury or failed saving throw the character might
        suffer while studying.</p>
        <p>Until a character prepares spells from a spell book, the only
        spells available to cast are the ones that the character already
        had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During
        the study period, a wizard chooses which spells to prepare. If a
        character already has spells prepared from the previous day that
        have not been cast, the character can abandon some or all of
        them to make room for new spells.</p>
        <p>A character can prepare the same spell more than once each
        day. Each preparation counts as one spell toward the character’s
        daily limit for each spell level. If a spell has multiple versions, the
        character must choose which version to use when the character
        prepares it, unless the spell description specifies that the choice
        is made upon casting.</p>
        <p>When preparing spells for the day, the character can leave some
        spell slots open. Later during that day, the character can repeat
        the preparation process as often as the character likes, time
        and circumstances permitting, to fill these unused spell slots.
        Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least
        one hour and 15 minutes of game time. The character cannot,
        however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with
  another one, or fill a slot that is empty because the character
  has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation can
  only be done during the first study period after resting.</p>
  <p>Once a character prepares a spell, it remains in the character’s
mind until the character triggers it through casting or until
the character abandons it. Upon casting, the spell is purged
from the character’s mind. Certain other events, such as the
disruption of a spell during casting, the effects of magic items
or special attacks from monsters can wipe a prepared spell from
a character’s mind. If a character dies, all spells stored in the
character’s mind are wiped away.</p>


<h4 id="prepclerdru">Clerics and Druids</h4>
<p>Clerics and druids prepare their spells in largely the same
manner. They choose and prepare spells ahead of time, just as a
wizard or illusionist would, but clerics or druids do not require
spell books. Instead, clerics select and prepare spells ahead of
time, through prayer and meditation, at a particular time of day.</p>
<p>Some deities set the time or impose other special conditions
for granting spells to their clerics. If some event prevents the
character from praying at the proper time, the character must
do so as soon as possible thereafter. If the character does not
stop to pray for spells at the first opportunity, the character must
wait until the next day to prepare spells.</p>
<p>The time required for a divine spellcaster to prepare spells is
the same as for a wizard. There must be eight hours of rest each
day before prayer, and at least one hour of that rest must be
immediately prior to prayer. It takes 15 minutes per spell to pray
for and receive the spell. There must be a relatively peaceful
environment in which to pray. Unlike arcane magic-users whose
choice of spells is limited to those in their spellbook, a cleric or
druid may pick any spell from the applicable spell lists unless the
character’s deity imposes a restriction.</p>
<p>As with arcane spells, at the time of preparation, any spells cast
within the previous eight hours count against the number of
spells that can be prepared. Like arcane magic-users, a divine
spellcaster does not have to prepare all of his or her spells at
once. However, the character cannot fill a slot that is empty
because the character cast a spell or abandoned a previously
prepared spell at any time other than during the first daily spell
preparation. In all other respects, the spell preparation rules for
wizards and illusionists apply to clerics and druids.
</p>



<h3 id="acquiring_new_spells">ACQUIRING NEW SPELLS</h3>
Spellcasters, both arcane and divine, seek to add new spells to
their repertoire but the process for adding new spells is different
for each.

<h4 id="acquiring_wizill">Wizards and Illusionists</h4>

Most arcane spellcasters desire, beyond all other treasure, the
acquisition of new spells for their spell books. Wizards and
illusionists learn and add new spells through several methods.

<p> <b>Gaining a level: </b>just as a fighter constantly practices with
his weapons, a wizard or illusionist spends time researching and
learning about arcane magic and spells. When a character gains
a new level, he chooses one new spell to add to his spell book.
The spell chosen must be of a level the character can cast. For
example, upon attaining second level, a wizard may add one
additional first-level spell to the character’s spell book. The
wizard automatically knows the spell and can prepare it.</p>

<p> <b>Deciphering Spells:</b>  to decipher spells in another’s spell
book or a scroll, a character must first cast read magic on the
spell to be deciphered. Once the character successfully casts
read magic, the character can learn or attempt to learn a new
spell and add it to a spell book. The rules for adding new spells
to a spell book depend upon the source of the spell. Even reading
spells already known by a character contained in another’s spell
book requires the casting of read magic, because no two spells
are inscribed alike.</p>

<p>Once a wizard deciphers a spell book or scroll, the character
does not need to decipher it again to read it at a later time.
Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify the
spell and gain some idea of its effects although the character
must still learn the spell in order to cast it. If the magical writing
is a scroll, the wizard can use the scroll.</p>


<p> <b>Learning and Copying Spells:</b> a character must
first decipher the spells contained in a spell book or scroll as
described above. Thereafter, the character can learn the new
spell from the book by spending one day plus one day per level
of the spell being learned in study of it. If the person who created
the spell book is on hand to help the reader, the reader can
learn the spell in one-half the normal time. The number of days
necessary to learn the spell is reduced by a number of days equal
to the character’s intelligence modifier, with a minimum of one
day. The castle keeper may choose to require the character to
make a successful intelligence check to learn a new spell (after
the necessary days of study). Once the new spell is learned, the
character can copy it into a spell book, as described below. The
process of copying leaves the spell book or scroll from which it
was copied unharmed.</p>

<p> <b>Writing Spells:</b> once a wizard understands a new spell, it
can be copied into a spell book. The process requires one day
plus one additional day per spell level. Zero-level spells require
one day. A spell takes up one page of the spell book per spell
level. Zero-level spells take up a single page. A normal spell
book has 200 pages. Materials for writing a spell cost 100gp per
page of the spell.</p>


<p> <b>Replacing Spellbooks:</b> the same procedure for learning
a spell is used to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If the character
already has a particular spell prepared, the character can write it
directly into a new book at a cost of 100gp per page. The process
wipes the prepared spell from the character’s mind, just as casting
it would. If the spell is not prepared, the character may not
reconstruct it from memory but can prepare it from a borrowed
spellbook and then write it into a new book. Duplicating an
existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, except
that the time requirement and cost per page are halved.</p>


<p> <b>Research:</b> a character can also research a spell
independently, duplicating an existing spell from the spell list
or creating an entirely new one. At the end of the process, the
character must write the spell into a spell book.</p>


<p> <b>Reading a Scroll into a spellbook:</b> a character
must first decipher the spell contained on a scroll by casting read
magic. Because a scroll is magical, and the reduction of the spell
to the scroll involves all the necessary components for casting
the spell from the scroll, a character can simply read a scroll into
a spell book. Doing so copies the spell to the character’s spell
book, but destroys the scroll in the process.</p>

<h4 id="acquiring_clerdru">Clerics and Druids</h4>
Characters who can cast divine spells undertake a certain
amount of study of divine magic between adventures. Each time
a character receives a new level of divine spells, the character
learns the new spells from that level automatically. For example,
a cleric reaching third level is granted knowledge of all spells on
the second-level cleric spell list by their deity.
<p>Additionally, a cleric or druid can research a spell
independently. Only the creator of such a spell can prepare
and cast it, unless the character decides to share it with
others. Some such creators share their research with their
churches, but others do not. The character can create a magic
scroll (provided they are high enough level) or write a special
text, similar to a spell book, to contain spells the character
has independently researched. Other divine spellcasters who
find the spell in written form can learn to cast it, provided
they are of sufficient level to do so and are of the same class
as the creator. The process requires deciphering the writing
(see Divine Magical Writings, below).</p>

<p><b>Divine Magical Writings:</b> Divine spells can be written
down and deciphered just as arcane spells can, except read magic
is not used to do so. Instead, the character can decipher and
learn the new spell from the scroll by spending one day plus
one day per level of the spell being learned in study of it. Only
characters who have the spell in question on their class-based
spell lists can cast a divine spell from a scroll.</p>
<p>A character who wishes to cast a spell announces his intention
to the Castle Keeper during the character’s initiative turn.
A character must make all pertinent decisions about a spell
(range, target, area, effect, etc.) when the character begins
casting, unless the spell specifies otherwise. The character must
make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where
the effect is to originate, depending on the type of spell. The
Castle Keeper applies whatever results a spell entails using the
spell’s description.</p>
<p>To cast a spell, the character must be able to speak (if the
spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic
component), and manipulate the material components or focus
(if any).The spell descriptions indicate which components are
necessary. Additionally, the character must concentrate to
cast a spell (see below). If something interrupts the character’s
concentration while casting, the spell is lost and marked off the
character’s list of prepared spells. If the character ever tries to
cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics of the spell
(range, area, etc.) cannot be made to conform, the casting fails
and the spell is wasted.</p>
<p>Many spell durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours,
or some other increment. When the duration expires, the spell’s
effect ends.</p>


<h3 id="concentration">CONCENTRATION</h3>
<p>To cast a spell, the character must concentrate. If something
interrupts the character’s concentration while the character
is casting, the spell is lost and marked off the character’s list
of prepared spells. Sometimes, the Castle Keeper may allow a
concentration check (against the appropriate ability, typically
intelligence or dexterity) to see if the spell is simply disrupted
(and not lost) or even not interrupted (casting is completed).</p>

<p>Getting hurt or being affected by hostile magic while trying to
cast a spell can break the character’s concentration and ruin a
spell. If while trying to cast a spell the character takes damage,
fails a saving throw or is otherwise successfully assaulted, the
character’s casting is disrupted unless the Castle Keeper allows
a concentration check. The interrupting event strikes during
spellcasting if it comes during the time when the character
starts and completes a spell (for a spell with a casting time
of more than one full round). Anything that could break the
character’s concentration when casting a spell can also break
the concentration necessary to maintain a spell. A character
can’t cast a spell while concentrating on another one.</p>


<p>The only spells the character can cast while grappling or pinned
are those without somatic components and whose material
components the character has in hand at the time. Even so,
the Castle Keeper will often require a concentration check for
the character to cast the spell. Vigorous motion, such as from
riding a mount, the rocking of a small boat in rough water or
simply being jostled in a similar fashion, might necessitate a
concentration check.</p>


<h3 id="using_a_scroll">USING SCROLLS</h3>

Scrolls are spells reduced to a portable form. Not only does a
scroll contain the text of a spell, all the necessary components,
except verbal, have been magically incorporated into the scroll.
Before using a scroll, a character must decipher it by casting
read magic. The character can then read the scroll aloud, casting
the spell contained on it just as if the character had the spell
prepared. The spell’s casting time, range, area of effect, duration
and all other details and limitations are no different. A spell
contained on a scroll may only be cast once. When a spell is cast
from a scroll, the spell disappears or destroys the scroll.
<p>There are some limitations on the use of scrolls, of course. A
character must be of a class that can cast the type of spells
contained on the scroll. For example, a druid cannot cast wizard
spells from a scroll.</p>

<p>A character can cast a spell from a scroll that they have not
learned or recorded in their spell book. However, the character
must be of a high enough level to cast the level of spell found
on the scroll. For example, a 2nd level wizard finds a scroll and
casts read magic on it, revealing that it contains the 1st level
spell magic missile. The wizard had not previously learned magic
missile, and does not have it recorded in his spell book. The
wizard, however, can cast 1st level spells and thus can cast magic
missile from the scroll.</p>

<p>A character can attempt to use a scroll to cast a spell of a level
they are not normally able to cast, but they must first make an
intelligence check to do so. A penalty to the intelligence check
equal to the level of the spell is applied to the roll. Failure indicates
that the spell fails and the scroll is destroyed. For example, the <b>2nd
level</b> wizard deciphers a scroll bearing teleport, which is a <b>5th level
spell </b> the wizard cannot normally cast. The wizard attempts to
cast the spell from the scroll, but he must first make a successful
intelligence check with a <b>challenge level of five</b>.</p>

<p>Spells can be learned and copied from scrolls normally, and
doing so does not destroy the scroll.</p>
