<br><br>


<h3>Brutal Hurl</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14

<p>Attacker throws through the shoulder rather than the wrist
using their great strength rather than keen agility.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Attacker uses their strength bonus instead of their
dexterity when making ranged attacks with hurled weapons.

<br><br>

<h3>Double Hurl</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 14, BtH +6

<p>Attacker throws two hurled weapons at the same time at the
same target.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b>The attacker takes one attack roll at -2. If the attack
hits, it deals double damage but adds strength damage only once
to the throw.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The attacker may not move in the same round that
they attempt a double hurl advantage. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Great Hurl</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14 or Strength Prime

<p>Attacker may hurl a non-traditional weapon as if it were a
hurled weapon with a reduced penalty to attack.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The attacker takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls instead of
a -4 when hurling a nontraditional weapon such as a battle axe,
greatsword, or the like in battle. The non-traditional weapon
has a base range of 15ft. when used in this fashion by a hero with
the great hurl advantage.

<p> <b>Special:</b>When hurling an object (or individual) of equal
size, the attacker must succeed a strength prime check before
attempting an attack roll.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Heroic Throw</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14, Strength Prime, BtH +11

<p>The attacker can hurl a weapon with legendary force or accuracy.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The attacker gains a +2 to-hit and double damage on
a successful strike with a hurled weapon.

<br><br>

<h3>Juggling Toss</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 15, Dexterity Prime, Bth +2

<p>You can juggle multiple objects in the air and toss them at a
target while juggling.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> You can make a number of thrown attacks equal to the
number of objects you are juggling, but each attack is at -4 on
the roll. You can juggle a number of objects equal to 2 + your
dexterity modifier.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The objects juggled must be small enough to be
manipulated with a single hand. A dagger or hatchet-sized
throwing axe is the largest object that can be tossed with this
advantage. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Longhunter</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 13

<p>Being the best archer on the field isnâ€™t always about how hard the
bow is to pull, but how to use elevation and wind to advantage.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Missile attackers increase their range by 1.5 and add
+1 point of damage at attacks up to the standard range but not
beyond it.

<b>Special:</b> This additional damage does not stack with the
sharpshooter advantage, but merely extends the range at which
the attacker gains bonus damage. The archer may not move
during the round they are using this advantage unless they have
the skirmisher advantage as well.

<br><br>

<h3>Powerful Hurl</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14, Strength Prime, BtH +1

<p>Some peltasts sacrifice accuracy for power, attempting to impale
foes with a single blow.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Hurler may sacrifice up to +4 to their BtH in exchange
for additional damage.

<br><br>


<h3>Sharpshooter</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 13

<p>When firing missile weapons at close range, the attacker hits
foes in vital areas and avoids hitting allies.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Attacker deals +1 damage when within 30 ft. Missed
attack rolls also miss allies, even if a natural 1 is rolled.
<br><br>


<h3>Skirmisher</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 13

<p>Adept hunters and missile weapon specialists can fire on the
move without penalty.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The skirmisher advantage allows a missile weapon
specialist to move their full movement rate in a round and still
fire or hurl their weapon.

<p> <b>Special:</b> While moving and firing, the character suffers a -2
penalty to armor class as their focus is more intent on their
target than their surroundings.</p>
