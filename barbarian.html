  <div id="myDIV">
    <p>Beyond the walls of cities and towns, and well beyond
    the bounds of civilization, dwell the barbarians. From
    windy steppes to mountain tops, from deep jungles
    to arid plains, barbarians live in freedom, a part of the world
    around them rather than a slave to it. Banded together in family
    clans or tribal nations, barbarians are a free people ruled by
    strength and custom alone, subject to no state or empire. They
    judge others by their actions and deeds. To them deeds of valor
    are held in the greatest acclaim.</p>
    <p>To a barbarian, “civilization” defines weakness.</p>
    <p>Barbarian characters are fearsome warriors, closer to the
    primordial life than are most others. They are fearlessly reactive,
    trusting that only through bold and decisive actions are the
    fates confounded. Barbarians rely upon their individual skills
    and instincts to carry them through difficult tasks or demanding
    ventures, drawing upon their primeval instincts and powers to
    overcome foes. They are fearless in their own belief that their
    strengths are unconquerable.</p>
    <p>The supernatural dominates their culture and they see magic in
    many things. They are able to tap into the supernatural world and
    often do so in the guise of charms, totems and the like. Conversely
    they will never rely upon it. Ever. Magic is a luxury even as are the
    soft cushions and colored wines that besot
    the men of cities and towns. It is a sign
    of weakness. At his core the barbarian
    is a primordial creature who believes
    that only his natural powers, abilities,
    and instincts stand between him and a
    miserable fate or cowardly death.</p>

    <p>Barbarians are born and raised in the
    wilder lands, outside the influences
    of civilization. They are found in every
    climate and every terrain, and have an acute
    knowledge of the environment in which they
    are raised. They possess a general knowledge of its
    weather patterns, the resources that are available,
    whether plant or animal, the seasonal challenges
    and the various dangers posed. This knowledge
    is a second nature to them and allows them to
    survive the rigors of life in the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>Living in the wilds and at the whims of uncaring
    nature takes great fortitude, inuring barbarians to
    the physical demands of this life, so that they
    persevere through its inflictions and its pains
    with steely determination. Possessed of a
    staggering constitution, they are capable of
    absorbing damage that would kill their
    more civilized cousins.
    Neither ignorant nor savage,
    barbarians are masters of their
    destiny.</p>
<p>Neither ignorant nor savage,
barbarians are masters of their
destiny. A barbarian’s self-reliance and solitary nature however, does not lead them to abhor the
company of others. They may be insular and suspicious of
outsiders, but when a barbarian comes to trust others and call
them friend, no stronger ally can be found in all the world.</p>

<p>Barbarian adventurers are generally free of the bonds and
fetters that tie down most peoples, even their brethren in
their own tribal nations. Above all else, barbarians value their
independence and often maintain their own codes or beliefs.
Many have died from voicing opposition to tribal leaders, but
are respected all the more, for they spoke or acted upon their
beliefs. This cultural background fosters a willful nature and
temperament that many view as chaotic and ill disciplined.
Barbarians value the wind in their hair and victory in battle
over their enemies.</p>

<p>Utilitarian by nature, most barbarians rarely carry more than
necessary and accumulate little in the way of treasures and
properties – preferring instead cold steel blades, light armor, and
items of little bulk.</p>

<h5 id="barbarian_combat_sense">COMBAT SENSE</h5>
A barbarian has an uncanny sense for
the presence of foes in the immediate vicinity, reducing the
effectiveness of surprise, flank and rear attacks against them.
Barbarians gain a +2 bonus when rolling a surprise check against
foes attempting to surprise them. Also, attackers do not get any
bonus when attacking a barbarian from the flank. Similarly,
back and rear attacks against a barbarian are halved, including
special attacks such as the rogue’s back attack. Thus, for
example, a rogue using the back attack
ability against a barbarian gains only
a +2 bonus to hit instead of +4.

<h5 id="barbarian_deerstalker">DEERSTALKER</h5>
This ability
comes naturally to all
barbarians and covers a
wide range of survival
skills. In short it is their
natural ability to endure
environments that lesser men
would find harsh.
The Deerstalker is able to forage off the land, finding
shelter, food, and water for themselves, start a fire,
and determine direction. As long as adequate
food, water, and shelter sources are present in
the environment, a barbarian can find these
resources without the need for an attribute check.
This requires 1d6+2 hours of hunting, foraging,
building, and gathering. He can do this only
for himself. A barbarian can start a fire in 1d10
minutes by natural means, as long as the needed
materials are available. A barbarian also can
determine true north in relation to the
character, as long as he is in a wilderness
environment.
<p>With the deerstalker ability barbarians are capable of climbing
typical natural slopes and inclines, such as a steep, rocky hillside
cliff, without the need to make an attribute check. Barbarians
can ford and swim typical rivers and bodies of fresh water.
When climbing or swimming, the barbarian moves at one-half
normal movement. When climbing or swimming a barbarian
cannot wear armor weighing more than 25 lbs., and must set
aside any accoutrements that weigh over 25 lbs or are unusually
encumbering.</p>

<h5 id="barbarian_intimidate">INTIMIDATE (CONSTITUTION)</h5>
Barbarians offer an
imposing display of ferocious raw power. They instinctively
realize that victory lies in the wine-besotted, soft demeanors of
their foe and that brute force works best when combined with
overwhelming terror. Barbarians are able to project themselves
as this brutal, terrifying force. Whether through sheer force of
will, or savage decorum, a barbarian is able to strike fear into and
intimidate his opponents. While attacking and upon a successful
constitution check any creature of equal or lesser hit dice of
the barbarian suffers -2 to all rolls, including but not limited
to initiative, attack, damage and attribute checks. This ability
takes effect as soon as the barbarian uses the ability. He must
announce it before rolling initiative. It has a 15 foot radius area
of effect. Intimidate is usable only once per combat encounter.
At 1st level, a barbarian can intimidate one creature. The
number of creatures intimidated increases with level as follows:
up to 2 creatures at 3rd level, up to 4 creatures at 6th level, up
to 8 creatures at 10th level, and up to 16 creatures at 15th level.
The intimidation ends the moment the barbarian fails to strike
the intimidated creature.
<h5 id="barbarian_primeval_instincts">PRIMEVAL INSTINCTS</h5>
Barbarians are able to tap into a
strength that goes beyond the physical and gives them a fearless
edge. This strength is primeval in its nature, driven by instincts
that are closer to those of animals than men. Under difficult
circumstances they tap into this primeval instinct in attempting
Herculean tasks. This ability is only accessible if the barbarian
throws himself at the challenge, whether in the beginning of the
round or as a last ditch effort. Any move on the character’s part
to flee, hesitate, or to debate the action, immediately negates the
primeval instincts and the barbarian cannot act upon them or
use them to overcome the action. When using this ability, if the
physical action is of such difficulty that the Castle Keeper requires
a physical attribute check (strength, dexterity, or constitution),
the barbarian gains a +4 to the check. The barbarian cannot use
this ability if they are wearing armor weighing 25 lbs. or more, or
has fled from the challenge. It is important to note that even if the
situation is a last ditch effort, if the barbarian has fled previously,
he cannot use primeval instinct.
<p>This ability also allows the barbarian to hold his breath for
a period of time, run long distances, and survive longer in
extreme temperatures and weather conditions. None of these
abilities require an attribute check. Instead, they are limited
in duration. Barbarians can hold their breath for a number of
rounds equal to their constitution score. Barbarians can survive
in extreme environments, temperature, and weather conditions
for one day more than a normal person could do so. And, a
barbarian’s great fortitude allows them to run long distances
without tiring easily. When calling upon this inner fortitude,
the distance a barbarian can travel in a day is doubled.</p>


<h5 id="barbarian_whirlwind_attack">WHIRLWIND ATTACK</h5>
At 4th level, a barbarian’s combat
sense and athleticism merge in a fearsome and deadly ability.
With this ability, the barbarian can combat multiple enemies
surrounding him. The barbarian must announce use of the
ability before attacking and he cannot retreat before using it. The
whirlwind attack is usable only once per combat encounter and
replaces their normal combat action. When used, the barbarian
gains an attack roll against two opponents as long as those
enemies are within 5 feet or less of the barbarian and possess no
more than one-half of the barbarian’s hit dice. For example, two
second level fighters attempt to jump a barbarian in an alley;
the barbarian may make a whirlwind attack, gaining one attack
against each of the fighters. The number of foes subject to the
whirlwind attack increases as the barbarian rises in levels. At 6th
level the barbarian can attack up to 3 opponents, and at 10th
level a barbarian can attack 4 opponents. The ability does not
progress beyond 10th level.

<h5 id="barbarian_primeval_will">PRIMEVAL WILL</h5>

At 6th level, a barbarian’s stoic nature
increases his longevity on the battlefield. When fighting a hard
pressed combat with mounting wounds the barbarian can call
upon this ability. To use the ability, the barbarian’s hit points
must be reduced to a specific number, as follows: 12 hit points
or less at levels 6-9; 18 hit points or less at levels 10-14; and 24
hit points or less at levels 15 and up.
<p>When battle or circumstances reduce a barbarian’s hit points
to the specified number of hit points or less, the character can
use this ability to immediately gain an additional 12 hit points.
Damage inflicted after the barbarian activates the ability is first
absorbed by the 12 hit points granted by primeval will. The
additional hit points last only for the duration of the combat.
When the affects of the ability wear off, the barbarian must
remove any hit points remaining from the 12. The ability can be
used only once per day.</p>

<p>Primeval will grants an additional, unique ability as well. It
can save the barbarian from an attack that would normally
strike the character dead or unconscious. If a barbarian suffers
damage such that reduces the character to zero or negative hit
points before the barbarian can use this ability, it automatically
activates and imparts an additional 12 hit points. If the
additional hit points raise the barbarian character’s total hit
points to 1 or more, the barbarian may keep fighting. Note that
if a blow strikes the barbarian and reduces their hit point to -10
hit points or beyond, the primeval will ability cannot save the
character. Also, removal of these hit points cannot reduce the
barbarian beneath 1 hit point.</p>


<h5 id="barbarian_ancestral_calling">ANCESTRAL CALLING</h5>
At 10th level a barbarian’s reputation
and prestige allows them to call upon others to fight alongside
the barbarian with heightened ability. The affected creature
gains hit points equal to the maximum of one extra hit die
for the creature. For example, an affected fighter would gain
an additional 10 hit points. The ability affects a number of
creatures equal to twice the barbarian’s level. The ability only
affects creatures of equal or lesser hit dice. The effect lasts for
no more than one day, or until completion of a specific task, or
as long as the Castle Keeper allows. The barbarian can only use
this ability once per week and it cannot be used in conjunction
with another barbarian’s use of the same ability. It is important
to note that this ability does not affect morale nor is it based
upon a barbarian’s charisma. Instead, it is the barbarian’s force
of will and reputation that causes those around him to heed his
call and rise to the task set before them.
