<h3>Determining Encumbrance</h3>
A character has an Encumbrance Rating equal to their strength
score. This is then modified by the character’s prime attributes.
If the character has either the strength or constitution
attributes as prime, they may add 3 to their Strength Score
to determine their Encumbrance Rating. If the character has
both strength and constitution as prime, then they may add 6.
This Encumbrance Rating is the total amount of Encumbrance
Values the character can carry before being Burdened.

<p>A character is considered Unburdened, Burdened, or Overloaded
according to the amount of EV they are carrying. If the
character is carrying less than their Encumbrance Rating in EV,
then they are Unburdened. If they are carrying more than their
Encumbrance Rating, but less than triple their ER then they are
Burdened. A character that is carrying more than three times
their Encumbrance Rating is considered Overburdened.</p>


<h4>Effects Of Encumbrance</h4>
The effects of carrying too much equipment are potentially
hazardous to characters. Much care needs to be given to how
much is being hauled around. The penalties to movement and
attribute checks are listed on the chart.


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Encumbrance Category</th>
    <th>Weight</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unburdened</td>
    <td>Up to 1x ER</td>
    <td>No Effect</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Burdened</td>
    <td>1x ER to 3x ER</td>
    <td>-10 ft to character’s Move Score (minimum of 5 ft), +2
to Challenge Level of all Dexterity Based Checks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overburdened</td>
    <td>More than 3x ER</td>
    <td>Move reduced to 5 feet per round, Automatically
fail all Dexterity Based Checks, Lose Dexterity
bonus to AC</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Worn and Capacity Objects</h4>
<p>Items that are designed to carry and redistribute the weight and
bulk of other items are called Capacity Items. Capacity Items can
carry a number of items equal to their Capacity. Furthermore,
a Capacity Item cannot carry any item whose EV is equal to or
greater than it’s Capacity rating. So a Backpack, with a Capacity
of 8, can carry up to 8 items whose EVs are 7 or less.</p>

<p>Items that are carried in a Capacity item do not have their
EV included in the character’s Encumbrance Total. Instead,
the character only notes the EV of the Capacity item. So the
character wearing an EV 2 Backpack that has a Bedroll (EV
3), hammer (EV 2), 50 nails (EV 1), and one torch (EV 1)
has five items in the Backpack (and thus has space for three
more items). The character’s Encumbrance Rating is only
increased by 2 when they carry the Backpack, ignoring the
EVs of the items inside of it.</p>


<h4>Coins</h4>
There is no way to determine exact weights and encumbrance
of coin. Use the following for a baseline. Each coin in C&C
is roughly 1 ounce. This would make gold coins, as the metal
is heavier, smaller than silver coins, whose metal is lighter.
Every 16 coins is equal to a pound. However coins have
almost no bulk to them, but may have weight. A single coin,
or a pound of coins, has no appreciable EV. Ten pounds, or
160 coins, is equal to 1 EV.
