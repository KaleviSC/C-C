<h3>Armored Hero</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Armor Proficiency (Any)

<p>Mighty is the hero who knows how best to use their second skin
to their advantage.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The character selects one particular type of armor
as their signature armor. While in their signature armor, the
character adds an additional +1 to their armor class.

<p> <b>Special:</b>This advantage may be taken multiple times. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Curtain of Steel</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +1

<p>As deadly blows rain down from all directions, it is often prudent
to increase one’s defenses in exchange for melee acumen.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Put simply, a character using the curtain of steel
advantage may sacrifice up to +4 of their BtH on attack rolls in
exchange for an equal increase in armor class. This advantage
stacks with dodge. While in the curtain of steel, the character
may only move ½ of their movement rate as they seek to actively
parry incoming blows with shield and weapon.

<br><br>

<h3>Dodge</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> None

<p>Awareness of attackers leads to a more engaged defense.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The dodge advantage allows a character to add +1
to their armor class against a single foe during any given melee
round. The defender must be able to see the attacker before it
can be dodged.

<br><br>

<h3>Elusive Grappler</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity Prime

<p>The combatant is a clever wrestler adept at slipping free from
any attempts to hold or pin them.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Their base armor class against grapple attacks is 20.

<br><br>

<h3>Legionnaire's Shield</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Armor Proficiency (Shields)

<p>The shield-bearing warrior with this advantage is specialized in the
use of their shield to defend their vitals against oncoming attacks.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> With this advantage, the shield user gains an additional
+1 to armor class while bearing a shield in battle.

<br><br>

<h3>Myrmidon's Shield</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Armor Proficiency (Shields)

<p>Professional warriors know the quality of a good sturdy shield to
actively fend off foes.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The myrmidon’s shield advantage allows a shieldbearing
warrior to fend off one additional blow per round. Thus
a fighter using this advantage with a buckler gains the use of the
buckler against two attackers instead of one.

<br><br>

<h3>Sure-Footed Warrior</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> None

<p>Combatants are familiar with pitching and churning ground, or
opponents who seek to take them off their feet.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Combatants with this advantage add +2 to their armor
class against trip and overbearing attacks.
