<br><br>


<h3>Acrobatic Maneuver</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Dexterity 15, BtH +2, Sneak Attack ability

<p>With an acrobatic maneuver, the character places themselves in
a position to attack a foe from any angle.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> With a successful dexterity check at a CL equal to the
foe’s level, the character maneuvers into position and gains an
attack using the sneak attack ability.

<br><br>

<h3>Cleaving Strike</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14

<p>Skilled warriors take advantage of the passing of one enemy,
with a sudden strike against a second adjacent foe!</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When a hero manages to drop one foe in melee combat,
they gain an immediate attack against a second adjacent foe.
This free attack is at the full attack bonus of the hero.

<p> <b>Special:</b> This ability stacks with the combat dominance class
ability of the fighter, and works against any hit dice of foe. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Climbing Fighters</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +1

<p>Not all fights take place on flat ground, for those who tend to
find themselves fighting on precarious inclines or hanging from
ropes and walls, the climbing fighter advantage has its benefits.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Possessing legendary climbing ability, dexterity, and
strength, the fighter suffers no penalty to their armor class while
climbing any surface. In addition, if they can grasp with only
one hand, such as to a rope, pole, piece of rigging, or depression
in a stone wall, a successful strength check (no modifiers) allows
them to make an attack with a one-handed weapon.

<p> <b>Special:</b> When used in combination with the run-by attack
advantage, one could easily swing past an opponent on a rope
or chain and strike them while moving.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Cross Block</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> None

<p>Combatants who focus on two-handed weapons, use every part
of their weapon to both engage enemies and defend themselves.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> While fighting with a two-handed weapon (staff,
polearm, two-handed axe, two-handed sword, etc.), the
combatant gains a +1 armor class bonus against a single
opponent in the combat round.

<br><br>

<h3>Flash Kick</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +6

<p>In a flashy display of showmanship and dexterity, the character
forgoes their normal attack in an attempt to kick an opponent
hard enough to knock them down.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The move is dependent on speed and technique rather
than raw strength and requires that they move at least 10 feet
before launching their feet into the opponent. Whether they
swing from a rope, around a pole, flip off the ground, or simply
charge the opponent is up to the combatant. The combatant
must make a successful attack roll to hit and a dexterity check
(CL=lvl or HD of the target + their dexterity bonus, if any) to
knock them off balance. The victim of this attack suffers 1d6
points of damage and must make a successful strength check
(CL=combatant’s level) to avoid being knocked prone.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The victim must be humanoid and the same size as
the combatant or smaller. Dwarves standing on earth or stone
receive a +4 bonus on the strength check against this attack. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Intimidating Strike</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +6

<p>The combatant delivers a blow so fearsome it can drive their foe
from the battlefield.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When combatant rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll,
they deliver a terrifying blow that unnerves the stricken foe.
The target must make a successful charisma save or flee the
battlefield as quickly as they can.

<b>Special:</b> If using the Fields of Battle mass combat rules, an
intimidating strike requires a morale check rather than a
charisma save.

<br><br>

<h3>Power Attack</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Strength 14, Strength Prime, BtH +1

<p>Some heroes make the sacrifice of accuracy to deal greater
damage in battle.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> Combatants may sacrifice up to -5 of their BtH and
convert this into greater damage.

<b>Special:</b> Typically, as a Castle Keeper’s option, a strength
prime check could be allowed to replicate this advantage. In
doing so, the challenge level is +1 per point of damage, and
the attacker must have a BtH of at least +1. When taking
this ability as an advantage, the extra strength prime check is
simply avoided.

<br><br>

<h3>Run-By Attack</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +1

<p> Combatants can make a single attack against a creature as they
run past it. As long as the combatant moves in a straight line,
they can attack any single creature along that path. Fighters
with extra attacks can use their second attack against a second
creature but only if it is also within their reach as they run past.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The attack receives a +2 bonus, but the focus on
movement makes it more difficult to defend themselves,
inflicting a –2 penalty to the user’s AC. A successful dexterity
check (CL= level + dexterity bonus, if any) by the victim grants
them the ability to strike back at the combatant before they are
out of reach. A successful attack does not stop the movement.

<br><br>

<h3>Sacrificing Riposte</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +1

<p> Once per round, the combatant can turn the weapon back
against an attacker that successfully strikes and damages them.
The combatant makes a dexterity check immediately after
being struck and damaged.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> If successful, the combatant may make an ordinary
attack with their own weapon (or bare hands in the case of a
monk) against the attacker that injured them. A failed check
indicates the character was not able to bring their weapon
around quickly enough to strike back, but the riposte is not used
up. The character may make additional dexterity checks if struck
with other blows until they have made one riposte per round.

<br><br>

<h3>Swift Strike</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +1

<p>Nothing finishes a fight faster than hitting first.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When unburdened by heavy armor and bags, the
character can make the most of their speed and grace granting
them a +2 bonus to all initiative checks during a combat
round. So long as they remain unencumbered, they are able
to anticipate their opponents’ actions and act on them swiftly
enough to gain an advantage.

<p> <b>Special:</b> The character must remain unencumbered to use this
advantage, and are unable to use this advantage while wearing
any armor with an encumbrance value of 3 or higher. The CK
may allow some types of armor based on strength and skill level. </p>


<br><br>

<h3>Tripping Blow</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Use of Two-handed Weapon

<p>Attackers using two-handed weapons (spears, polearms, staves,
and the like) are experts at knocking their opponents prone.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When using a two-handed weapon, the attacker adds
+3 to attacks rolls for purposes of knocking their foe prone (see
Trip under Combat Maneuvers above).

<p> <b>Extra:</b>Flails, chains, and whips, and monk unarmed attacks
also receive the bonus of this advantage. </p>


<br><br>

<h3>Two-Handed Slam</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> None

<p>Combatants using a weapon two-handed put extra muscle into
their blows, dealing additional damage, at a price.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> While using a weapon two-handed, or a two-handed
weapon, the combatant adds an additional 1 point of damage
with a one-handed weapon and two points of damage using a
two-handed weapon.

<p> <b>Extra:</b> This extra damage does not exclude small weapons such
as daggers, hand axes, and the like as extra force may be added
to any blow. When attempting to add more damage to the blow,
the attacker suffers a -1 penalty to their Armor Class during the
round that this advantage is used. </p>


<br><br>

<h3>Two-Handed Expert</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> BtH +3

<p>Warriors improve their ability to fight with a weapon in each
hand.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> The penalty for fighting with a weapon in each hand is
reduced to -1 primary, -4 offhand, so long as the weapon in the
second hand is light. As normal, attribute bonuses to dexterity
offset the penalty further.

<p>Additionally, characters may choose instead to defend
with their offhand, gaining a +1 bonus to their armor class.
Characters choosing to thus defend themselves take no penalty
to attack roll with their primary hand. Characters may alternate
techniques from round to round but must decide which action
they are going to take before the first attack against them, or on
their turn, whichever comes first.</p>

<p> <b>Special:</b> Characters wielding two identical light weapons, such
as a pair of short swords, or a pair of daggers suffer no penalty
with their primary hand when this advantage is taken, although
the -4 penalty for their off hand still applies. </p>

<br><br>

<h3>Vaulting Kick</h3>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Use of a polearm, spear, or staff, BtH +4.

<p>Attackers using a long hafted weapon such as a spear, staff, or
polearm vault into the fray, taking a kick attack that drops their
opponent, offering an extra attack against the prone opponent.</p>

<b>Benefit:</b> When making a trip or overbearing attack, the
combatant uses the haft of the weapon to vault kick their
opponent to the ground. If the attack succeeds, the attacker
gains an automatic attack against the prone opponent but does
not add their BtH to this extra attack roll.

<p> <b>Special:</b> An attacker may substitute a 10 ft. pole for a weapon
to use this advantage. </p>
