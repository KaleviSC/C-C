<p>The following proficiency descriptions are arranged alphabetically, not
according to character class. Each description gives a general outline of what a
character with the proficiency knows and can do. Furthermore, some descriptions
include rules to cover specific uses or situations, or exact instructions on
the effects of the proficiency.</p>

<br>
<br>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="agriculture">Agriculture:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character has a knowledge of the basics of farming. This includes
planting, harvesting, storing crops, tending animals, butchering, and other typical
farming chores.
    <P></P>

    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="ancient_history">Ancient History:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character has learned the legends, lore, and history of some ancient time
    and place. The knowledge must be specific, just as a historian would specialize
    today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the Roman
    Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have ancient periods in mind for his game
    or can allow the players to name and designate them.) Thus, a player character
    could know details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time of the
    Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.
    <P></P>
     The knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity with the principal
    legends, historical events, characters, locations, battles, breakthroughs
    (scientific, cultural, and magical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the
    time. The character must roll a proficiency check to identify places or things he
    encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite a bit about the Coming
    of the Trolls, a particularly dark period of dwarven history. Moving through
    some deep caverns, he and his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed
    for untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a successful
    proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar to those he has seen on
    “banned” portals from the time of Angnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
    <P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="animal_handling">Animal Handling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
Proficiency in this area enables a character to exercise a greater-than-normal
degree of control over pack animals and beasts of burden. A successful
proficiency check indicates that the character has succeeded in calming an excited or
agitated animal.
    <P></P>

    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="animal_lore">Animal Lore:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency enables a character to observe the actions or habitat of an
    animal and interpret what is going on. Actions can show how dangerous the
    creature is, whether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending a nearby den.
    Furthermore, careful observation of signs and behaviors can even indicate the
    location of a water hole, animal herd, predator, or impending danger, such as a
    forest fire. The DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful check
    means the character understood the basic actions of the creature. If the check
    fails by 4 or less, no information is gained. If the check fails by 5 or more,
    the character misinterprets the actions of the animal.
    <P></P>
     A character may also imitate the calls and cries of animals that he is
    reasonably familiar with, based on his background. This ability is limited by volume.
    The roar of a tyrannosaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a normal
    character. A successful proficiency check means that only magical means can
    distinguish the character's call from that of the true animal. The cry is sufficient to
    fool animals, perhaps frightening them away or luring them closer. A failed
    check means the sound is incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still
    fool some listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry automatically
    detect a false call. All other creatures and characters are allowed a Wisdom check
    to detect the fake.
    <P></P>
     Finally, animal lore increases the chance of successfully setting snares and
    traps (for hunting) since the character knows the general habits of the creature
    hunted.
    <P></P>



    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="animal_training">Animal Training:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Characters with this proficiency can train one type of creature (declared when
    the proficiency is chosen) to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A
    character can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of creatures or
    can improve his skill with an already chosen type. Creatures typically trained
    are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character
    can choose even more exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence
    (although these are difficult to control).
    <P></P>
     A trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time. The trainer may
    choose to teach general tasks or specific tricks. A general task gives the
    creature the ability to react to a number of nonspecific commands to do its job.
    Examples of tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy labor,
    hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A
    specific trick teaches the trained creature to do one specific action. A horse may
    rear on command, a falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a
    specific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze. With enough time, a
    creature can be trained to do both general tasks and specific tricks.
    <P></P>
     Training for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted work.
    Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks. At the end of the training time, a
    proficiency check is made. If successful, the animal is trained. If the die
    roll fails, the beast is untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general
    tasks or specific tricks, or any combination of the two.
    <P></P>
     An animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing them for
    training later on). Wild animals can be tamed only when they are very young. The
    taming requires one month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of
    the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the beast is suitable for
    training. If the check fails, the creature retains enough of its wild behavior
    to make it untrainable. It can be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
    <P></P>



    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="appraising">Appraising:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as it allows characters to
    estimate the value and authenticity of antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut
    gemstones, or other crafted items they find (although the DM can exclude those items
    too exotic or rare to be well known). The character must have the item in hand to
    examine. A successful proficiency check (rolled by the DM) enables the
    character to estimate the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to
    identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate a price at all. On
    a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads the value of the item, always to
    the detriment of the character.
    <P></P>


    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="armorer">Armorer:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This character can make all of the types of armor listed in the <I>Player's Handbook,</I> given the proper materials and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency
    check is rolled at the end of the normal construction time.
    <P></P>
     The time required to make armor is equal to two weeks per level of AC. For
    example, a shield would require two weeks of work.
    <P></P>
     If the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of the amount
    needed for success, the armorer has created usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor
    functions as 1 AC worse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was
    intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can detect the flaws, and
    this requires careful and detailed inspection.
    <P></P>
     If the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural die roll of 19 or
    20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately worsens by 4 additional classes
    (although never below 10), and the broken armor hampers the character's
    movement. Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process requiring 1d4
    rounds), the character moves at ½ of his normal rate and suffers a -4 penalty to
    all of his attack rolls.
    <P></P>
     If an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate armor, the
    character who will use the armor must be present at least once a week during the
    creation of the armor, since such types of armor require very exact fitting.
    <P></P>

    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="artistic_ability">Artistic Ability:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Player characters with artistic ability are naturally accomplished in various
    forms of the arts. They have an inherent understanding of color, form, space,
    flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select one
    art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be proficient in.
    Thereafter they can attempt to create art works or musical compositions in their given
    field. Although it is not necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be
    made to determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the
    artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If the check fails, the
    artist has created something aesthetically unpleasing or just plain bad.
    <P></P>
     Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency checks requiring
    artistic skill--music or dance--and to attempts to appraise objects of art.
    <P></P>


    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="astrology">Astrology:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">

    This proficiency gives the character some understanding of the supposed
    influences of the stars. Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the
    astrologer can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare a forecast of the
    future for that person. The astrologer's insight into the future is limited to
    the next 30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. If a successful
    proficiency check is made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a great battle,
    a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The DM decides the exact prediction
    (based on his intentions for the next few gaming sessions). Note that the
    prediction does not guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result.
    If the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained unless a 20 is
    rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly inaccurate.
    <P></P>
     Clearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance knowledge on the
    part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible for the DM to avoid the
    question, although this shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make their
    DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider using this proficiency
    at the end of a gaming session, giving the DM until the next session to come up
    with an answer. The DM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his
    adventures--something that will prompt the player characters to go to certain
    places or to try new things.
    <P></P>
     Characters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus to all navigation
    proficiency checks, provided the stars can be seen.
    <P></P>


    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="blacksmithing">Blacksmithing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with blacksmithing proficiency is capable of making tools and
    implements from iron. Use of the proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed fire
    and bellows, as well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot make armor or
    most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling hooks, horseshoes, nails,
    hinges, plows, and most other iron objects.
    <P></P>

    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="bowyer_fletcher">Bowyer/Fletcher:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  This character can make bows and arrows of the types given in <A HREF="DD01615.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DD01615.htm">Table 44</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">.
    <P></P>
     A weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can
    perform all other necessary functions. The construction time for a long or short
    bow is one week, while composite bows require two weeks, and 1d6 arrows can be
    made in one day.
    <P></P>
     When the construction time for the weapon is completed, the player makes a
    proficiency check. If the check is successful, the weapon is of fine quality and
    will last for many years of normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the
    weapon is still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on the
    first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an unmodified 1 on his
    1d20 attack roll.
    <P></P>


    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="brewing">Brewing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character is trained in the art of brewing beers and other strong drink.
    The character can prepare brewing formulas, select quality ingredients, set up
    and manage a brewery, control fermentation, and age the finished product.
    <P></P>




    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="carpentry">Carpentry:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
    The carpentry proficiency enables the character to do woodworking jobs:
    building houses, cabinetry, joinery, etc. Tools and materials must be available. The
    character can build basic items from experience, without the need for plans.
    Unusual and more complicated items (a catapult, for example) require plans
    prepared by an engineer. Truly unusual or highly complex items (wooden clockwork
    mechanisms, for example) require a proficiency check.
    <P></P>

    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="charioteering">Charioteering:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with proficiency in this skill is able to safely guide a chariot,
    over any type of terrain that can normally be negotiated, at a rate 1/3 faster
    than the normal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character without this
    proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not impart the ability to move a
    chariot over terrain that it cannot traverse; even the best charioteer in the
    world cannot take such a vehicle into the mountains.
    <P></P>


    <FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="cobbling">Cobbling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can fashion and repair shoes, boots, and sandals.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B>Cooking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Although all characters have rudimentary cooking skills, the character with
this proficiency is an accomplished cook. A proficiency check is required only
when attempting to prepare a truly magnificent meal worthy of a master chef.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="dancing">Dancing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character knows many styles and varieties of dance, from folk dances to
formal court balls.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="direction_sense">Direction Sense:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with this proficiency has an innate sense of direction. By
concentrating for 1d6 rounds, the character can try to determine the direction the party is headed.
If the check fails, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a 1 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly opposite the true
heading. (The DM rolls the check.)
<P></P>
 Furthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character with direction
sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced by 5%.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="endurance">Endurance:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with endurance proficiency is able to perform continual strenuous
physical activity for twice as long as a normal character before becoming
subject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where extreme
endurance is required, a successful proficiency check must be made. Note that this
proficiency does not enable a character to extend the length of time that he can
remain unaffected by a lack of food or water.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="engineering">Engineering:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character is trained as a builder of both great and small things.
Engineers can prepare plans for everything from simple machines (catapults, river
locks, grist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is
required only when designing something particularly complicated or unusual. An
engineer must still find talented workmen to carry out his plan, but he is
trained to supervise and manage their work.
<P></P>
 An engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft and can detect
flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar construction. He knows how to
construct and use siege weapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
<P></P>




<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="etiquette">Etiquette:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">This proficiency gives the character a basic understanding of the proper forms
of behavior and address required in many different situations, especially
those involving nobility and persons of rank. Thus, the character will know the
correct title to use when addressing a duke, the proper steps of ceremony to greet
visiting diplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For
extremely unusual occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character
to know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, for example,
is a sufficiently rare event).
<P></P>
 However, having the character know what is correct and actually do what is
correct are two different matters. The encounters must still be role-played by the
character. Knowledge of etiquette does not give the character protection from
a gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing still manage to do
the exact opposite.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="fire_building">Fire-building:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character with fire-building proficiency does not normally need a tinderbox
to start a fire. Given some dry wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start a
fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not required. Wet wood, high winds,
or other adverse conditions increase the time to 3d20, and a successful
proficiency check must be rolled to start a fire.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="fishing">Fishing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it with hook and line, net,
or spear. Each hour the character spends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If
the roll is failed, no fish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line
or a spear will land fish equal to the difference between the die roll and the
character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three times this amount.
<P></P>
 Of course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found. On the other hand,
some areas teem with fish, such as a river or pool during spawning season. The
DM may modify the results according to the situation.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="forgery">Forgery:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
This proficiency enables the character to create duplicates of documents and
handwriting and to detect such forgeries created by others. To forge a document
(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific to
a person, the character needs only to have seen a similar document before. To
forge a name, an autograph of that person is needed, and a proficiency check
with a -2 penalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document written
in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of his handwriting is
needed, with a -3 penalty to the check.
<P></P>
 It is important to note that the forger always <I>thinks</I> he has been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency check in
secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until it is too late.
<P></P>
 If the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by all except those
intimately familiar with that handwriting or by those with the forgery proficiency
who examine the document carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is
detectable to anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--if he
examines the document closely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is immediately
detectable to anyone who normally handles such documents without close
examination. The forger will not realize this until too late.
<P></P>
 Furthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine a document to learn if
it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency roll, the authenticity of any
document can be ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the
answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches the incorrect
conclusion.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="gaming">Gaming:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  The character knows most common games of chance and skill, including cards,
dice, bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game, the character may either
play out the actual game (which may take too much time for some) or make a
proficiency check, with success indicating victory. If two proficient characters
play each other, the one with the highest successful die roll wins. A character
with gaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his
ability score. If the proficiency check for the game is 1 to 4, however, the
character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="gem_cutting">Gem Cutting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
A character with this proficiency can finish the rough gems that are
discovered through mining at a rate of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no
benefit from the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must work
with a good light source and must have an assortment of chisels, small hammers,
and specially hardened blades.
<P></P>
 Uncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable as the finished
product. If the cutting is successful (as determined by a proficiency check),
the gem cutter increases the value of a given stone to the range appropriate for
its type. If a 20 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value
of the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="healing">Healing:</B>  </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">A character proficient in healing knows how to use natural medicines and basic
principles of first aid and doctoring. If the character tends another within
one round of wounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his
ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points can be restored than were
lost in the previous round). Only one healing attempt can be made on a character
per day.
<P></P>
 If a wounded character remains under the care of someone with healing
proficiency, that character can recover lost hit points at the rate of 1 per day even
when traveling or engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded character
gets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day while under such care.
Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can help others
recover at the rate of 3 hit points per day of rest. This care does not require a
proficiency check, only the regular attention of the proficient character. Up
to six patients can be cared for at any time.
<P></P>
 A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to aid a poisoned
individual, provided the poison entered through a wound. If the poisoned character
can be tended to immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and the
care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 bonus to his
saving throw (delay his saving throw until the last round of tending). No
proficiency check is required, but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately
(normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and
cannot do anything himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned
character must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result
is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only
characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment
for poisons the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his
healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative).
<P></P>
 A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to diagnose and treat
diseases. When dealing with normal diseases, a successful proficiency check
automatically reduces the disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those
who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 bonus to this check. A
proficient character can also attempt to deal with magical diseases, whether
caused by spells or creatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check
diagnoses the cause of the disease. However, since the disease is magical in nature,
it can be treated only by magical means.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="heraldry">Heraldry:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The knowledge of heraldry enables the character to identify the different
crests and symbols that denote different persons and groups. Heraldry comes in many
forms and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to identify
noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political factions, and castes. The
symbols may appear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards,
clothing, coins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric patterns,
calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious symbols, and magical seals
(made for the express purpose of identification). Heraldry can vary from the
highly formalized rules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the knowledge
of different shield patterns and shapes used by African tribesmen.
<P></P>
 The character automatically knows the different heraldic symbols of his
homeland and whom they are associated with. In addition, if the character makes a
successful proficiency check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of
other lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the inhabitants of
that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon first entering a foreign
land.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="herbalism">Herbalism:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Those with herbalist knowledge can identify plants and fungus and prepare
nonmagical potions, poultices, powders, balms, salves, ointments, infusions, and
plasters for medical and pseudo-medical purposes. They can also prepare natural
plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must decide the exact strength of such
poisons. A character with both herbalism and healing proficiencies gains bonuses when
using his healing talent (see the <A HREF="DD01570.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="#healing">Healing</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3"> proficiency).
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="hunting">Hunting:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">When in wilderness settings, the character can attempt to stalk and bring down
game. A proficiency check must be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score
for every nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful, the
hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to 200 yards (100+1d100) of
an animal. The group can attempt to close the range, but a proficiency check
must be made for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful, the hunter
automatically surprises the game. The type of animal stalked depends on the
nature of the terrain and the whim of the DM.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="juggling">Juggling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can juggle, a talent useful for entertainments, diversions, and
certain rare emergencies. When juggling normally (to entertain or distract), no
proficiency check is required. A check is made when trying spectacular tricks
(&quot;Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!&quot;). However, juggling also enables the
character to attempt desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 20 (not a
proficiency check), the character can catch small items thrown to harm him (as
opposed to items thrown for him to catch). Thus, the character could catch a
dagger or a dart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the
character automatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path of a dagger is
likely to hurt).
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="jumping">Jumping:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can attempt exceptional leaps both vertically and horizontally.
If the character has at least a 20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump)
2d6+his level in feet. No character can broad jump more than six times his
height, however. With the same start, he can leap vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus
half his level in feet. No character can high jump more than 1-½ times his own
height.
<P></P>
 From a standing start, a character with this proficiency can broad jump 1d6
plus half his level in feet and high jump only three feet.
<P></P>
 The character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault requires at least
a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it must be four to 10 feet longer
than the character's height. The vault spans a distance equal to 1-½ times the
length of the pole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of the
pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault carries him over an
obstacle no higher than ½ the height of his pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the
character could either vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling
into the room beyond), land on his feet in an opening six feet off the ground,
or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped at the
end of the vault.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="languages_ancient">Languages, Ancient:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character has mastered a difficult and obscure tongue, now primarily found
in the writings of pedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use of the language
is to read tomes of ancient secrets written by long-dead mystics. This
proficiency enables the character to either read and write or speak the language (his
choice).
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="languages_modern">Languages, Modern:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character has learned to speak a language of the known world. To do so,
there must be a teacher available. This could be another player character, an NPC
hireling, or simply a local townsman.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="leatherworking">Leatherworking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  This proficiency enables a character to tan and treat leather and to make
clothing and other leather objects. The character can make leather armor, as well
as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and all sorts of harnesses.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="local_history">Local History:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">

The character is a storehouse of facts about the history of a region the size
of a large county or a small province. The character knows when the ruined
tower on the hill was built and who built it (and what happened to him), what great
heroes and villains fought and fell at the old battlefield, what great
treasure is supposed to be kept in a local temple, how the mayor of the next town
miraculously grew hair on his balding pate, and more.

<P></P>
 The DM will provide information about local sites and events as the character
needs to know them. Furthermore, the character can try to retell these events
as entertaining stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a
proficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire, or actually
tell the story to other characters. If the character succeeds in entertaining
them, the player need not make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has
succeeded. The character can tell these stories to entertain others, granting
him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the encounter. But telling stories to hostile
beings is probably not going to do any good.
<P></P>
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="mining"> Mining:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
A character with mining proficiency is needed to site and supervise the
operations of any mine. First, the character can attempt to determine what types of
ores or gems can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at least a
week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may rule that more area must be
searched to find anything of value and may thus increase the amount of time
required. At the end of the search, the character can say what is likely to be
found in this area. After this, the character can site the mine. On a successful
proficiency check (made secretly by the DM), the character has found a good site
to begin mining for any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not
guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the best choice in a
given area. The DM must determine what minerals, if any, are to be found in
the region of the mine. On a failed check, the character only thinks he has found
a good site. Much effort is spent before the character is proved wrong, of
course.
<P></P>
 Once the mine is in operation, a character with mining proficiency must remain
on site to supervise all work. Although this is a steady job, most player
characters will find it better to hire an NPC for this purpose.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="mountaineering">Mountaineering:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
A character with this proficiency can make difficult and dangerous climbs up
steep slopes and cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with
mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons (spikes) and
guiding the others, all in the party can gain the benefit of his knowledge. A
mountaineer can guide a party up a cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A
character with this proficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to his
chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is not the same as the
some classes climbing ability, since the latter does not require aids of any sort.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="musical_instrument">Musical Instrument:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character can play a specific musical instrument. An additional instrument
can be added for every extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The character
plays quite well, and no proficiency check is normally required. The DM may
direct the character to make a proficiency check in what he feels are extraordinary
circumstances.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="navigation">Navigation:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character has learned the arts of navigating by the stars, studying
currents, and watching for telltale signs of land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is
not particularly useful on land. At sea, a successful proficiency check by the
navigator negates the chance of getting lost.
<P></P>



<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="pottery">Pottery:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
A character with this proficiency can create any type of clay vessel or
container commonly used in the campaign world. The character requires a wheel and a
kiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally create
two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized item per day. The pieces of
pottery must then be fired in the kiln for an additional day.
<P></P>
 The raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small item, 5 cp to make a
medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make a large item.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="reading_lips">Reading Lips:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character can understand the speech of those he can see but not hear. When
this proficiency is chosen, the player must specify what language the
character can lip read (it must be a language the character can already speak). To use
the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of the speaker and be
able to see him speak. A proficiency check is made. If the check fails, nothing is
learned. If the check is successful, 70% of the conversation is understood.
Since certain sounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding of a
lip-read conversation is never better than this.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="reading_writing">Reading/Writing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  The character can read and write a modern language he can speak, provided
there is someone available to teach the character (another PC, a hireling, or an
NPC). This proficiency does not enable the character to learn ancient languages
(see <A HREF="DD01576.htm"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="#languages_ancient">Languages, Ancient</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">).
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id=religion>Religion:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
Characters with religion proficiency know the common beliefs and cults of
their homeland and the major faiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information
(type of religious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any
religion is automatically known by the character. Special information, such as how the
clergy is organized or the significance of particular holy days, requires a
proficiency check.
<P></P>
 Additional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character either to
expand his general knowledge into more distant regions (using the guidelines above)
or to gain precise information about a single faith. If the latter is chosen,
the character is no longer required to make a proficiency check when answering
questions about that religion. Such expert knowledge is highly useful to priest
characters when dealing with their own and rival faiths.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="riding_airborne">Riding, Airborne:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character is trained in handling a flying mount. The particular creature
must be chosen when the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can
be used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike land-based riding,
a character must have this proficiency (or ride with someone who does) to
handle a flying mount.
<P></P>

<A NAME="3a913dfc"></A><FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="riding_landbased">Riding, Land-Based:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">Those skilled in land riding are proficient in the art of riding and handling
horses or other types of ground mounts. When the proficiency slot is filled,
the character must declare which type of mount he is proficient in. Possibilities
include griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and virtually any creatures used as
mounts by humans, demihumans, or humanoids.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="rope_use">Rope Use:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  This proficiency enables a character to accomplish amazing feats with rope. A
character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all sorts of knots and can
tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or loosen with a quick tug.
If the character's hands are bound and held with a knot, he can roll a
proficiency check to escape the bonds.
<P></P>
 This character gains a +2 bonus to all attacks made with a lasso. The
character also receives a +2 bonus to all climbing checks made while he is using a
rope, including attempts to belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="running">Running:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character can move at twice his normal movement rate for a day. At the end
of the day he must sleep for eight hours. After the first day's movement, the
character must roll a proficiency check for success. If the die roll succeeds,
the character can continue his running movement the next day. If the die roll
fails, the character cannot use his running ability the next day. If involved in
a battle during a day he spent running, he suffers a -1 penalty to his attack
rolls.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="seamanship">Seamanship:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">The character is familiar with boats and ships. He is qualified to work as a
crewman, although he cannot actually navigate. Crews of trained seamen are
necessary to manage any ship.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="seamstress_tailor">Seamstress/Tailor:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character can sew and design clothing. He can also do all kinds of
embroidery and ornamental work. Although no proficiency check is required, the
character must have at least needle and thread to work.
<P></P>



<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="set_snares">Set Snares:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character can make simple snares and traps, primarily to catch small game.
These can include rope snares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be
rolled when the snare is first constructed and every time the snare is set. A
failed proficiency check means the trap does not work for some reason. It may be
that the workmanship was bad, the character left too much scent in the area, or
he poorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the problem does not
need to be known. The character can also attempt to set traps and snares for
larger creatures: tiger pits and net snares, for example. A proficiency check
must be rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both cases,
setting a successful snare does not ensure that it catches anything, only that
the snare works if triggered. The DM must decide if the trap is triggered.
<P></P>
 Setting a small snare or trap takes one hour of work. Setting a larger trap
requires two to three people (only one need have the proficiency) and 2d4 hours
of work.
<P></P>
Characters with animal lore proficiency gain a +2 bonus to their check
when attempting to set a snare for the purposes of catching game. Their
knowledge of animals and the woods serves them well for this purpose.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="singing">Singing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character is an accomplished singer and can use this ability to entertain
others and perhaps earn a small living (note that bards can do this
automatically). No proficiency check is required to sing. The character can also create
choral works on a successful proficiency check.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="spellcraft">Spellcraft:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
Although this proficiency does not grant the character any spellcasting
powers, it does give him familiarity with the different forms and rites of
spellcasting. If he observes and overhears someone who is casting a spell, or if he
examines the material components used, he can attempt to identify the spell being
cast. A proficiency check must be rolled to make a correct identification.
Note that since the spellcaster must be observed until the
very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does not grant an advantage
against combat spells. The proficiency is quite useful, however, for identifying
spells that would otherwise have no visible effect.
<P></P>
 Those talented in this proficiency also have a chance of recognizing magical
 or magically endowed constructs for what they are.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="stonemasonry">Stonemasonry:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
  A stonemason is able to build structures from stone so that they last many
years. He can do simple stone carvings, such as lettering, columns, and
flourishes. The stone can be mortared, carefully fitted without mortar, or loosely fitted
and chinked with rocks and earth. A stonemason equipped with his tools
(hammers, chisels, wedges, block and tackle) can build a plain section of wall one
foot thick, ten feet long, and five feet high in one day, provided the stone has
already been cut. A stonemason can also supervise the work of unskilled laborers
to quarry stone; one stonemason is needed for every five laborers. Dwarves are
among the most accomplished stonemasons in the world; they receive a +2 bonus
when using this skill.
<P></P>



<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="swimming">Swimming:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
A character with swimming proficiency knows how to swim.
Those without this proficiency cannot swim. They can hold their breath and float, but they cannot move themselves about in the water.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="tightrope_walking">Tightrope Walking:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character can attempt to walk narrow ropes or beams with greater than
normal chances of success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up or
down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character can walk 60 feet. One
proficiency check is made every 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a
fall. The check is made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface
is one inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if two inches to six
inches wide, and unmodified if seven inches to 12 inches wide. Wider than one foot
requires no check for proficient characters under normal circumstances. Every
additional proficiency spent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1.
Use of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in the
line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.
<P></P>
 The character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but he suffers a -5
penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful proficiency check at the
beginning of each round to avoid falling off. Since the character cannot
maneuver, he gains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is struck
while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency check to retain his
balance.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="tumbling">Tumbling:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character is practiced in all manner of acrobatics--dives, rolls,
somersaults, handstands, flips, etc. Tumbling can only be performed while burdened with
light encumbrance or less. Aside from entertaining, the character with
tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4 against attacks directed solely
at him in any round of combat, provided he has the initiative and foregoes all
attacks that round. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack roll by 2.
<P></P>
 On a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half the normal damage
from falls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of 10 feet or less. Falls
from greater heights result in normal damage.
<P></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="ventriloquism">Ventriloquism:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
The character has learned the secrets of “throwing his voice.” Although not
actually making sound come from somewhere else (like the spell), the character
can deceive others into believing this to be so. When using ventriloquism, the
supposed source of the sound must be relatively close to the character. The
nature of the speaking object and the intelligence of those watching can modify the
character's chance of success. If the character makes an obviously inanimate
object talk (a book, mug, etc.), a -5 penalty is applied to his ability score. If
a believable source (a PC or NPC) is made to appear to speak, a +2 bonus is
added to his ability score.


A successful proficiency check means the character has successfully deceived
his audience. One check must be made for every sentence or response. The
character is limited to sounds he could normally make (thus, the roar of a lion is
somewhat beyond him).
<P></P>
 Since ventriloquism relies on deception, people's knowledge of speech, and
assumptions about what should and shouldn't talk, it is effective only on
intelligent creatures. Thus, it has no effect on animals and the like. Furthermore, the
audience must be watching the character since part of the deception is visual
(&quot;Hey, his lips don't move!&quot;). Using ventriloquism to get someone to look
behind him does not work, since the voice is not actually behind him (this requires
the <I>ventriloquism</I> spell). All but those with the gullibility of children realize what is truly
happening. They may be amused--or they may not be.
<P></P>


<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="weaponsmithing">Weaponsmithing:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
This highly specialized proficiency enables a character to perform the
difficult and highly exacting work involved in making metal weapons, particularly
those with blades. The character blends some of the skill of the blacksmith with an

<FONT FACE="Georgia" COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="3"><B id="weather_sense">Weather Sense:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Georgia" SIZE="3">
This proficiency enables the character to make intelligent guesses about
upcoming weather conditions. A successful proficiency check means the character has
correctly guessed the general weather conditions in the next six hours. A
failed check means the character read the signs wrong and forecast the weather
incorrectly. The DM should roll the check secretly. A proficiency check can be made
once every six hours. However, for every six hours of observation, the
character gains a +1 bonus to his check (as he watches the weather change, the
character gets a better sense of what is coming). This modifier is cumulative,
although sleep or other activity that occupies the attention of the character
for a long period negates any accumulated bonus.
<P></P>
 Sometimes impending weather conditions are so obvious that no proficiency
check is required. It is difficult not to notice the tornado funnel tearing across
the plain or the mass of dark clouds on the horizon obviously headed the
character's way. In these cases, the player should be able to deduce what is about to
happen to his character anyway.
