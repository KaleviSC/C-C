<h3>EMPAHTY</h3>
A half-elf’s uncanny ability to empathize with
others is reflected in a +2 bonus to all charisma checks. This
ability can be combined with attribute check modification.

<h3>MOVE SILENTLY (DEXTERITY)</h3>
This ability allows silent
movement in wilderness areas. Half-elves can move up to
one-half the normal speed at no penalty. At more than onehalf
and up to the character’s full speed, the character suffers
a -5 penalty to the check. Any faster movement is practically
impossible (-20 penalty).

<h3>SPOT HIDDEN DOORS (WISDOM)</h3>
This ability allows halfelves
to spot secret, hidden and concealed doorways. A half-elf
passing within 5 feet of such a doorway is entitled to a wisdom
check. Success means that the half-elf notices the door as if
actively searching for it. When a half-elf does actively search for
such doorways, the bonus to the wisdom check is +1.

<h2>Half-elves with a human lineage possess these abilities:</h2>

<h3>ATTRIBUTE CHECK MODIFICATION</h3>
The human lineage
is reflected in a greater versatility than their elven kin, but
not quite as their human relatives. Half-elven characters are
allowed to choose one secondary attribute for which they gain a
+2 bonus to all attribute checks.

<h3>SPELL RESISTANCE (WISDOM)</h3>
Half-elves of human
lineage are somewhat resistant to spells and spell-like abilities
that charm or unnaturally cause sleep. When making saving
throws against these types of spells, a half-elf of human lineage
receives a +2 bonus.

<h2>Half-elves with an elven lineage possess these abilities:</h2>

<h3>ATTRIBUTE MODIFICATION</h3>
+1 to dexterity and -1 to constitution.

<h3>ENHANCED SENSES</h3>
Half-elves of elven lineage can see
farther than humans in just about every circumstance, including
torchlight, and can see clearly enough to read a road sign or
spot a shield device that is up to two miles distant when outside
during the day. They can also hear very well, and receive a +2
bonus to all checks involving listening.

<h3>SPELL RESISTANCE (WISDOM)</h3>
Half-elves of elven lineage
are particularly resistant to spells and spell-like abilities that
charm or unnaturally cause sleep. When making saving throws
against these types of spells, a half-elf receives a +4 bonus.
Half–Elf spell resistance allows a saving throw against sleep,
even though sleep normally does not have a saving throw.
